<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
The clear sun of July shone through the garden foliage,
making circles of light on the grass wherever the inter-woven
branches of the locusts allowed its passage.  Summer
rains had washed the air of all dustiness, swept the flags
of the courtyards neat and clean, given new life to the
climbing trumpet flowers and a mossy springiness to the
path round the overflowing pool, into the waters of which
the strong confident sunbeams seemed to plunge deeper
than they had ever before dared dive, and to stay, joyfully
exploring the green underdepths which matched the opulent
color of the garden.  For the garden too promised joyful
exploring.  One had to pass through courtyard after
courtyard, through many large-timbered doors swinging
on wooden axles and through each hallway of the Chinese
house, sprawled out in section upon section, before entering
this remote spot where the walls of gray tile shut out
the city so completely and gave the impression of such
space hidden in what really was quite small compass.
</p>

<p>
Here, like a hundred other wealthy families in their own
unseen gardens, the household were able to enjoy rest
from the urgent life of Peking yet never stray beyond the
gates of the Tatar city.  There was a sheltered pavilion in
which to sip hot tea, a zigzag bridge of wood crossing the
pool at its narrowest, shady nooks to suit the lazy reflective
moods of the angler, best of all&mdash;if there were children&mdash;a
labyrinth of stones, all heaped into grotesque mountains,
through which the child, his imagination nimbly
excited, could follow the circuitous path, absorbing the
landscape of miniature lakes and tiny waterfalls and
diminutive pagodas, and descend into the darkness of
dripping grottoes as if he were the hero of them all.
</p>

<p>
Children there were; from behind a round moon gate
came the clamor of their voices.  But one stopped,
astonished at the sight, for they were not the sedate children,
the long-gowned boys and gracefully clad girls, one
expected in so meditative a garden.  They were not the
offspring of Ming scrolls, as they should have been,
transferred into life itself from the leisurely brush-strokes of
old paintings, but strange barbarians, violent in their play,
electric in the energy with which they defied the sun and
its heat.
</p>

<p>
The moon gate opened on a place apart, a place of
shrubs and formal pathways, but with two large pine trees,
gnarled and misshapen as though they had outgrown
human efforts to distort their branches, and with bamboo
brake on all sides springing up in untidy profusion, yet
with the mystery of its deep shadows making the walls
seem more distant than they were.
</p>

<p>
In one of the middle branches of a pine tree sat a girl,
swinging her feet mischievously as she dropped cones on
the boy who lay at full length on the ground below.
Whether he was trying to read or to write or even to sleep
was not quite apparent, for, though he lay amid a litter of
books and paper, with a stick of ink precariously balanced
on the edge of an ink-stone and an unsheathed brush close
to his elbow, his one endeavor was to defend himself with
as little motion as possible from the bombardment above.
This he did chiefly by agile wriggling, seeming to
anticipate the course of each projectile by some sixth sense
that spared him the trouble of looking up and, when a
well-aimed cone struck his neck or his feet, strengthening
his defense by racy Chinese abuse.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was not the sportiveness of the children which
was so astonishing as their scantily free clothing and the
fact, at once remarkable, that they were not Chinese children
at all.  The girl was easily fourteen or fifteen, but she
swung on her bough with the unabashed grace of a
tomboy.  Her few garments suggested a creature that had
grown up wild and untrammeled, for they were quite out
of keeping with the delicate restraint of the garden or
with the decorous attire the Chinese prescribe for their
women.  She wore only a loose gauze vest and a pair of
white drawers fastened at her waist by a scarf of red silk.
Her slippers had been flung off at the foot of the tree.
Except for the heavy braid of hair tossed over her shoulders
and the rounded curve of her breasts this strange maid
might have been mistaken in her straight coolness for a boy
in disarray.  But the abiding memory of her, after even a
moment's glimpse, was that she was not Chinese; the
abiding memory was of arms and legs too white for the
Chinese skin, even for the creamy ivory hue of the aristocrat,
of a body longer, more fully built, feet more amply turned,
of cheeks livelier flushed than the face of the ruddiest
Chinese maiden, for the blood was not softened by that
darker tinge of the complexion which makes one think of
youth's picture painted on old silk.  It was a miracle that
under so ardent a sun the girl should have kept this spring-like
clarity of skin.  Unless in the deep color of her hair
and her eyes she seemed to make no concession to the
tropical warmth of July but to belong to forests where cold
streams from the mountains pass amid trees.
</p>

<p>
Her brother was equally foreign to the baked sandy
plains of Peking.  He was possibly thirteen, with dark hair
and dark eyes like the girl on the branch above him and
with the same inviolable fairness of skin.  He had reduced
the encumbrance of garb to its limits and lay contentedly
naked except for cotton trousers which he had rolled
half-way up his thighs.  So intent was he in countering pine
cones with wordy retorts that he let a whole column of ants
explore his shoulders unresented till suddenly his patience
broke; he leaped to his feet, as swift as any untamed
animal, and scrambled up the tree to grapple with his
tormentor.  The girl was too quick even for him and
escaped from limb to limb, taunting him with her bare feet
for his impudence in hoping to seize her.
</p>

<p>
The boy broke into English, most alarming English,
violent curses such as foreigners in China use to loose their
wrath on servants who luckily cannot understand, mixed
with phrases he could have learned only in books&mdash;he
showed at once that he had not acquired the tongue from
playmates of his own age but was speaking it from the need
to say something portentously terrible, something which to
his youthful consciousness would answer the purposes of
blasphemy.
</p>

<p>
"You filthy devil, Nancy," he shouted, "I will strike
you dead!  I will cause you to fall!"
</p>

<p>
Nancy answered him by peals of laughter.  She stood
poised with tantalizing ease, her hands held up to the
branch above her, and swayed back and forth without fear
of her brother's threats.  She exposed to derision the
bookish mould of his words.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you naughty boy, Edward, you will cause me to
fall, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Before the boy could move out upon her precarious
platform, she had let go her hold, doubled her knees, and
shot from bough to bough down the tree like a white
cascade or like snow shaken free from overladen branches.
</p>

<p>
Edward, seeing his enemy had escaped, was satisfied in
his turn to pelt her with cones and was vigorously at
battle when a third child, even younger, emerged from the
bamboo and protested at the noise of their quarreling.
This child, a girl, was decidedly different from the others.
She had Chinese complexion, Chinese features; she was
dressed in the hot-weather négligé which girls of her age
could wear in the privacy of the home, long loose trousers,
stockings, slippers, an apron, cut so that it covered the
front of her body and held in place by strings round her
back and her neck.  When she came up to Nancy, however,
and stood beside the taller girl, there was immediately
apparent a resemblance between the two children, a
resemblance baffling to decipher, for, even when allowance was
made for four years' disparity in age, no one could say it
consisted definitely in eyes or mouth or even in the slightly
un-Chinese prominence of the nose, yet the resemblance
was latently noticeable and was a likeness which included
the boy as well.  This second girl, then, gave some clue to
the history of these strange children; she was certainly
their half sister, and it took no great powers of deduction
to surmise European parents for them, the same father
and a Chinese mother for herself.  Exactly this was the
case.
</p>

<p>
Timothy Edward Oliver Herrick had been the subject
of Peking scandal twelve years before.  He had, to the
shocked astonishment of his friends, "gone Chinese,"
which was another proof, to those who hated the drudgery
of turning the pages of Giles's heavy dictionary, that too
much study of Chinese makes men mad.  He had come to
China at the early age of twenty&mdash;that was thirty years
back&mdash;and risen quickly from post to post in the Imperial
Customs, passing his examinations brilliantly, learning
much in all the ports of the Middle Kingdom, charming
society out of its stiffness by his wit and tact, penetrating
the aloofness of the mandarin, winning distinction in
diplomacy and sport, orders, badges, medals, cups, a whole
roomful of trophies, and marrying a girl fresh from her
schooling in England, the daughter of a consul and
undeniably the loveliest, in a decade, of those damsels who
return to enjoy a brief season with exiled parents in the
East.  So for four years they had lived, favored by wealth,
honor, love, the ingredients of a fairy tale, till on a sudden
Nancy Herrick died,&mdash;cholera that year struck down even
those in high places,&mdash;while her husband retired into a
seclusion he never again broke.
</p>

<p>
In appalled whispers it was mooted through Peking that
Timothy Herrick, with his two children, had taken house
in an obscure hutung of the Tatar city and that the
beautiful Nancy Herrick had been followed not by one Chinese
wife only but by several.
</p>

<p>
Gossip, for once, was true to the facts, probably because
society could think of no exaggeration more dreadful than
the truth.  At the back of twisting lanes, behind bright
blue doors studded with brass, Timothy Herrick had
created a new world of his own in the spacious security of a
Chinese house and there with his wife and his concubines
he lived the life of a mandarin.  He had discarded Western
clothes, Western ways, discarded his British nationality,
taken to a moderate use of opium, and now passed his
time between an erudite searching of the Buddhist
scriptures and the composition of severely classical poems.
</p>

<p>
Yet this placid consolation for sorrow, this refinement of
the patriarchal life which has stood the Chinese race so
well for centuries, had one or two irritants.  The first,
seemingly small yet vexing, was Herrick's chagrin at his
failure to grow a queue or, rather, at the futility of a brown
queue in a land of black-haired people.  He remembered
the ridiculous figure of a missionary who had tried this,
and knew that while his own florid face, with its heavy
eyebrows and moustaches, bobbed up oddly from the
collar of his lavender jacket, it would look none the less
incongruous if his square forehead were shaved and the
back of his head ornamented by a dwindling tail.  The
Revolution, however hateful its other changes, did at least
solve this problem of how to be completely Chinese by
making the queue unfashionable.
</p>

<p>
The second irritant was of another kind and quite
another degree; it grew in seriousness with the passage of
years and vexed the quiet of his sleep.  It was the fate of
Nancy and Edward, the two children of his first marriage.
For his other children, he did not worry; there were
several of them, from Li-an, a girl of eleven, down to an
infant son still being bumped in his cradle, but they were all
more Chinese than foreign and with the help of generous
betrothal gifts could be assimilated by the country of their
birth.  Nancy and Edward were different.  Although they
never knowingly had seen, apart from their father, another
member of their own race and in twelve years had left their
compound only on the rarest occasion and then in a
covered mule cart to visit the Western Hills, there was no
disguising their foreign blood.
</p>

<p>
It had seemed easy, when they were babies, to mould
them to their environment by education and custom and
speech, but there was a stubbornness inherent in their
nature which had resisted the Orient and kept the girl and
the boy exotic.  They had lost claim to any country and
grown up disinherited by West and East alike.  The father
saw this more and more plainly and regretted his selfishness
in keeping them when it would have been so easy to
send them to his kinsfolk at home.  At the time of his first
wife's death he could not bear to part with them.  They
were the only relic of a woman he had loved so well that
his whole after life had become a slow descent, because
his heart told him the hopelessness of living again on the
plane he had reached with her.
</p>

<p>
He had deliberately turned away from that life because
it was ended, cut short, impossible of being renewed.  He
had chosen in preference a life which would ask no
comparison with the past; the tale of his success was being
revealed in the relaxing lines of his mouth, the sensual
fullness of his chin, a hardening of the eyes.  The more
serenely burned the memory of his wife,&mdash;the years never
changing the austerity of her beauty, something perfect
like the imperishable beauty of jade,&mdash;the more
contemptuous did he grow in his thoughts of women, as if to
mark her apartness, and give rein to the amorous cruelty
of a tyrant.  One by one the children had seen the household
increase as some new young girl was bought to satisfy the
whims of their father, and one by one they had seen these
favorites, after serving their time as mistress and mother,
relegated to the women's quarters, which were daily
becoming more expensive a luxury.
</p>

<p>
But Herrick remained uncomfortable amid it all.  He
could not be morally at ease while these two wide-eyed
strangers from the West reminded him of his troublesome
duty.  They were holding him back from that complete
immersion in the indolent life he had chosen.  He could not
swallow the opiate of peace.  Their faces seemed to
reproach him for neglect; they were uncomfortably knowing.
He imagined them talking between themselves in the
candid youthful way which appraises too exactly the faults
of parents.  Theirs had been a curious education because
Herrick had made it plain from the first that they were not
to be interfered with by the Chinese women of his household.
</p>

<p>
Trouble had begun after Li-an was born, the stepmother,
with a child of her own to advance, having tried to cow
these children of an alien mother by petty acts of jealousy,
which it was fortunate for Nancy and Edward they had the
championship of their old nurse to resist.  This nurse had
been with them all their lives, and, by fighting tooth and
nail each effort to reduce their position, had won for them
a freedom from the quarrels and intrigues of the family.
As Li-an soon had other rivals to dispute her inheritance,
her mother had trouble enough in wielding her sway over
the rank of inferior wives and was content to let the
foreign girl and boy go their way alone.  So they were in
the family but not of it, intimately subject to the direction
of only one person, the old amah, who humored and spoiled
them, telling them always that they were superior beings
and secretly undoing their father's attempt to make them
Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Herrick's desire was one the amah hotly resented.  She
had the peculiar loyalty of an old servant and, remembering
Nancy's mother with an affection close to worship, looked
with contempt on the women who had followed.  They
were trash.  She was not going to let Herrick's aberrations
of passion ruin the hopes of her foster children.  With
the servile fidelity of a dog she had attached herself to
creatures of an alien race, had wrapped her interests in
theirs, till her one wish was to see Miss Nancy and Master
Edward restored to their own people, where their station,
she was sure, would be almost royal.  So she fed them with
marvelous tales of the West; of its greatness; tales of their
own importance.  She waited on their moods like a slave
and produced in them a bearing of haughty independence
which they never quite laid aside, even when they mixed
in play with their half brothers and half sisters or took
their part chattily in the gossip of the inner courts.
</p>

<p>
Their formal education, for a long time, had been only
in Chinese, the old classical education to which Herrick was
partial.  They had learned to recite the Four Books and
much of the Five Classics and had passed through the
obsolete training of Chinese youth, from the redundant
exercises laid like a yoke upon children&mdash;the Tri-metrical
Classic, the Thousand Character Classic&mdash;to the pleasanter
fields of T'ang poetry, which their teacher explained
to them with unusual interest and skill, so that Nancy and
Edward often amused themselves patterning upon the hero
and heroines of the <i>Red Balcony</i> in contests for writing
verse of their own.  They wrote well.  They spent hours over
characters and could fill a scroll with swift symmetrical
strokes.  They could draw and paint landscapes which they
had never seen, landscapes of mountain and valley, temple
and trees, delicately colored after the unwavering
tradition of the past.  This, except for the few novels their
teacher approved, <i>The Three Kingdoms</i>, <i>The Dream of the
Red Balcony</i>, and <i>Travels in the West</i>, and the many
which he did not approve, novels they begged secretly
from the women of the household and which related with
utmost frankness every physical detail of intercourse
between the sexes,&mdash;though the talk they had listened to
all their lives left them little need to be enlightened
further,&mdash;this promised to be the whole of their education till
their father began, in a hesitating way, to teach them
English.
</p>

<p>
Timothy Herrick had not intended such instruction.  It
marked the first timid thought of surrender, a breach in
the logic of their training.  But Nancy at ten so disquieted
him that he could not rest till he had made some amends
for depriving her these many years of the birthright of
her native speech.  If his plans did fail,&mdash;he would not
admit that they could,&mdash;if she and her brother did resist
their absorption into Chinese life, he could give them this
means of saving themselves.  It was the least he could do,
but it meant the possibility of sending them to England,
should the need come, where among the uncles and cousins
and aunts, to whom he had written not a word in a decade,
there were certainly some who could take his children in
charge.
</p>

<p>
He taught them, however, with discretion, always
reminding them that English was a foreign tongue.  So
Nancy and Edward, though they learned to speak with a
considerable if bookish fluency, looked upon English very
much as an English schoolboy looks upon Latin, as a
speech dealing with far-off times and manners.  They liked
to use it between themselves from the sheer mischievous
pleasure of mystifying the other children of the
compound; there was the spiteful relish of abusing to their
faces people who were not a word the wiser.  Then again it
was a bond with their father, of whom they grew measurably
fonder now that he and they constituted a little
aristocracy to which no others had access.  Herrick himself
soon realized this and liked it less; it was another
subtle influence helping to tear him asunder.  But when
once the habit of daily lessons was formed he could not
give up the grave companionship of these two children,
who, fight the thought as he would, came closer to his heart
than all the tumbling black-haired brats of the compound.
</p>

<p>
Yet the first thoughts of the girl and the boy were always
Chinese.  Their background was the Confucian background
of their long-nailed teacher, though there were side paths
of course into Buddhist and Taoist lore, things they learned
from the women or from the nuns who came to collect
alms.  Of Western history and life, of wars and political
changes, they knew scarcely more than the Chihli farmer
ploughing his sandy fields or the Mongolian camel-driver
leading his tinkling caravan on the night road to Peking.
What they heard, except from the few colorless English
books they were allowed, was the chatter and gossip of the
courts.  Newspapers did not come into the women's
quarters; these were kept in that sombre room, their father's
study, where they dared go only when invited.  So they
felt themselves better than the Chinese they mingled with,
but no kin to the prodigious people of the West.
</p>

<p>
This was both more and less than Timothy Herrick had
planned.

CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
The bell rang for tiffin.  The servants were very punctilious
about this bell.  The custom of ringing it, imported
by the amah for the seemly benefit of her two children, had
become a family rite and the subject of much pride to the
women, who boasted to the families round about that they
were always called to meals by this stately summons.  Such
was Nancy's and Edward's deference to the custom that
they rushed immediately to their rooms, Li-an only a step
behind them, and had soon appeared, clad in trousers and
jacket, to do honor, as their nurse had taught them, to the
formality of the noonday meal.
</p>

<p>
Herrick of course did not eat with them.  The condescension
was not expected.  But the size of his family was
amply demonstrated by the women and children who had
gathered round the square tables in the room which was
referred to rather proudly as the dining-room, although
dining was only one of its dozen functions.  Nancy and
Edward sat at one table with their half sister Li-an and
her mother, the woman who as Herrick's wife held the
right of first place in the household.
</p>

<p>
Hai t'ai-t'ai, as she was called, was not an old woman;
she had been less than twenty when her father, Herrick's
teacher for many years, a man harassed by a shoal of
impecunious relations, saw profit to his family and the
strengthening of a curious attachment in marrying his
daughter to this wealthy Commissioner of Customs.  But
responsibilities had aged her appearance till she seemed
nearer fifty than thirty,&mdash;responsibilities and much good
eating,&mdash;so that she was now a stout matronly person
with the wooden masklike face which goes with dignity.
On her shoulders fell the management of the establishment,
the settlement of the many disputes which were
bound to arise where wives and maids and menservants and
children of several breeds were so inextricably mixed.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, she was equal to her place.  She maintained
her rule with considerable strictness, controlled expenditure
thriftily enough to lay aside means of her own, saw that
Li-an, if she could not lord it over Nancy and Edward,
could at least lord it over the inferior brothers and sisters
that had followed.  She would not have exchanged the
privileges of power for the less substantial marks of favor
which fell to the lot of the younger wives.  From only one
person could she claim no obedience; that was the nurse.
But Hai t'ai-t'ai, in the happy old Chinese manner of
compromise, tacitly recognized the care of the two white
children as a matter outside her province, accepting them
as though they were ambassadors with treaty rights in her
kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Between the two other tables the four concubines and
their families were divided.  To the casual observer they
seemed an amiable, good-tempered group, knit together
into a queer democracy, democracy based upon a man's
more volatile affections, yet there was not a person among
them who did not have her own pretensions and rights, so
that the family, if all secrets could be told, was the most
carefully graded of principalities.  Since all of them, like the
t'ai-t'ai herself, had been chosen because they satisfied
Herrick's fastidious notions of beauty, all were young, all
were vivacious and handsome.  It was not fading of feature
but cares of motherhood that had caused each in turn to be
supplanted, although none of them could claim her master's
love to the exclusion of the others.
</p>

<p>
As secondary wives, they lacked of course the rank of
the t'ai-t'ai; they also lacked her gentility.  But they were
not deterred by the fact of inferior station from grumbling
over her control and imagining ways of replacing her in the
management of the family.  The oldest of these concubines
felt particularly aggrieved because she had borne her
master two sons and by Chinese custom should have stepped
definitely ahead of a wife who had borne but one miserable
daughter.  She felt her injury more deeply as the years
passed; the delights of the table, from which she could not
hold herself back, were visibly altering the daintiness of
her figure and she deemed it only fair, only the natural
course, that she should regain through her sons the
influence her body was resigning.
</p>

<p>
Of the other three, two had been mothers once and had
the prospect of soon being mothers again, while the last
was a young slave girl of seventeen who had been exalted
to the rank of mistress by the recent whim of her master.
The two mothers were pretty, ordinary women, very much
wrapped in their children and busier ramming chopsticks
into those sticky mouths than in filling their own.  They
accepted the lead of the first concubine, aligning themselves
with her complaints, but they were always properly docile
in the presence of the t'ai-t'ai and, if left alone, would have
found business enough in the care of their children.
</p>

<p>
But the newest concubine, the reigning favorite in Timothy
Herrick's affections, was an animated contrast to the
three who had preceded her.  While they were handsome,
she was brilliantly beautiful, an exquisite figure and face,
with creamy skin, glowing eyes, lips which needed no
scarlet paint to accentuate their color, heavy black hair
that shone by an iridescence of its own to which the oil of
elder bark could have added nothing.  She was the only one
of his wives with whom Herrick had become definitely
infatuated.  Such was his delight in her company that for
days she did not appear at meals with the other women
or enter their apartments, but shared the board as well as
the bed of her master.  In consequence she was so bitterly
disliked that any of her three predecessors gladly would
have thrust a knife into her breast or marred her body by
slow torture.
</p>

<p>
It was a further cause for quarrel with the t'ai-t'ai that
this wanton creature had been taken particularly under her
protection.  Indeed, she was accused of having brought
about Kuei-lien's advancement.  Most of the slave girls
were coarse drudges, soon polluted by the sluttery of their
living quarters.  Kuei-lien not only had been bought at the
instance of the t'ai-t'ai but made the subject of partial
treatment, spared the harder tasks, given better clothes,
and defended from the familiarity of the menservants.
So there was reason to perceive more design than accident
in Herrick's discovery of the girl and his command
that she be divested of her humble attire, bathed, dressed
in costly silks, and brought like a queen to his chamber.
</p>

<p>
The relationship of Nancy and Edward to the four
mistresses of their father was most informal.  They were not
shocked by the function of these women because they had
never been taught to be shocked.  It was an ordinance of
nature that a man should have as many wives as he could
afford, a sign that all was well with the business
investments from which Herrick drew his income.  The boy and
girl moved quite freely through the house and were on
amiably chatty terms with its inhabitants.  They played with
the children, most of course with Li-an, who had been
longer their playmate and was a fair partner in their
quarrels and their peacemakings; they fell out now with
one group, now with another, but most often with each
other, so that no one grieved long over these usual bickerings
of children.  In the jealousies of the household they
had not been involved.  The women had treated them with
advised caution, preferring not to complicate their intrigues
by introducing a new and unstable ingredient.  They did
not understand the two foreign children, and so treated
them with a careful friendliness such as committed
themselves neither to enmity nor to love.
</p>

<p>
But Kuei-lien had disdained these wary tactics.  She had
set herself quite openly to win Nancy's affection and of
course had met no reverse, since the charm which had won
the father was easily adaptable to winning the daughter.
Nancy even had asked the t'ai-t'ai to put Kuei-lien at the
table with them, but this slight upon the others Hai t'ai-t'ai
and the amah both agreed was not politic.  Still there was
nothing to prevent Kuei-lien's spending much time in
Nancy's room, which the others never entered of their
own accord, where talk, replete with zest and flavor, helped
the intimacy to grow.
</p>

<p>
The championship of the amah had won her charges
more seclusion than the others enjoyed.  The house, like
all Chinese houses, was of many sections, divided by
courtyards, and, like the houses of the North, it was
substantially built.  Occupants and servants and even the dogs
moved with no thought of privacy through its rooms and
hallways, that is, through all except the portion allotted to
Nancy and Edward.  Now that the brother and sister had
grown too old to live together, they had been given the
choicest part of the house and the innermost, where they
lived, virtually isolated, between the garden and the last
of the courts, with the t'ai-t'ai and their amah for the only
immediate neighbors.
</p>

<p>
They could have asked no place more charming.  Their
rooms were to left and right of the hallway; which was
continued in a straight line through every section of the
house so that if all the heavy middle doors had been opened
the garden could have been seen from the street as at the
end of a long tunnel.  Their doors and windows faced
the courtyard and this was a very pleasant place.  Locust
trees towered on either side; from their lowest branches
hung cages in which canaries sang and starlings raucously
mimicked human speech.  Into the pavement two small
pools had been built, where goldfish flashed their tails as
they swam to and fro round islands of porous rock on
which tiny houses and temples and bridges and figures
of men and women, in fascinating diversity of posture, had
been set to give lifelikeness to the mossy crags.  There
were flower beds too, multicolored in their profusion of
zinnia and canna and marigold, while a vine with diminutive
scarlet blossoms climbed the bamboo scaffolding, across
which matting was rolled to break the glare of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Here Nancy and Edward enjoyed very comfortable
quiet.  Except when servants went through to wash clothes
in the pond, they were seldom disturbed; the concubines
preferred the liveliness of their own courtyard and rarely
went walking in the garden till the afternoon sun had gone
down.  All day long, after the clothes had been beaten dry
on flat stones and the thumping of wooden paddles had
ceased, the children heard only the songs of their birds and
the agreeably shrill noise of the cicada.
</p>

<p>
Since her preferment, however, the slave girl Kuei-lien
had become a visitor to Nancy's room and at any hour of
the day, when the children were not shouting their lessons
from the adjacent schoolroom, might lift the screen of
Nancy's door and enter.  The afternoon was the time she
liked best to come, when the shady coolness of Nancy's
room was a refuge from the child-infested chambers of her
own quarter.
</p>

<p>
It was a simple room but spacious, divided into two parts
by a screen of carved wood in which was an octagonal
opening, quaintly shaped, to allow passage from Nancy's
bedchamber to what in effect was her parlor.  The furniture
was not sumptuous; the carpets had been removed at the
beginning of summer and the stone floor covered with
matting.  There were the usual stiff-backed wooden chairs
and one or two reclining ones of wicker, narrow tables on
which stood gaudy vases, cheap and disagreeably shaped.
The walls were decorated with Nancy's own efforts at
painting.  In the bedchamber were boxes of white pigskin
where the girl stored her clothes.  The bed itself was a
large varnished affair inlaid with different woods.  Four
posts held up the muslin mosquito curtain.  Nancy, never
having known steel springs or horsehair mattresses, was
quite content with the wicker network over which she had
spread a thin cotton pad, leaving the heavier quilts and the
mat, which was the coolest to sleep upon in sultry weather,
rolled to one side of the bed.
</p>

<p>
It was here Kuei-lien usually found the girl lying,
comfortably divested of the outer garments she donned only
for meals and classes, her head raised upon a bamboo
pillow and her hand slowly fanning the knees she had drawn
up in front of her.  Kuei-lien herself would slip off trousers
and jacket and lie on the bed beside her or squat
cross-legged on a large low stool and share with Nancy the
cigarettes which helped their confidences.  And Edward, if he
were bored or too lazy to sleep, made a third and teased
the girls with pleasant sedateness proper to a hot afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Their talk was sophisticated.  Nancy was curious about
the forbidden topic of marriage, eager to gain all the
knowledge she could from the experience of her father's
mistress.  To Chinese girls of her age marriage loomed on
the horizon, so that it was little wonder she exercised much
ingenious fancy in pondering who her husband was to be.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you will marry an Englishman," said Kuei-lien.
</p>

<p>
"But I have never seen an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
"Your father is an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, my father is too old!"  Such was Nancy's respect
for Kuei-lien's superior acquaintance with life that she
never thought of the concubine as only two years older
than herself, nor that what her words suggested in her own
case must also be true in Kuei-lien's.  And there was the
further difference that a concubine is not a wife; for a
man of fifty to take a concubine of seventeen was only
reasonable; to take a wife of seventeen would have been
extraordinary.  Nancy could not have imagined a man
living unmarried to the ripe age of fifty.
</p>

<p>
"My father is too old.  What does a young Englishman
look like?  Have you ever seen one?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I've seen many," replied Kuei-lien, ignoring,
if she was aware of it, Nancy's defect of tact.  "There
are many young Englishmen in Peking.  They have yellow
hair and red faces and big teeth and big moustaches like
your father's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The young ones?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the young ones.  I think they are born with
moustaches.  They wear short coats, and look very hot, and
always say 'goddam' to their friends."
</p>

<p>
The picture was too repulsive.
</p>

<p>
"I won't marry an Englishman," said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Then what will you marry?" put in Edward.
</p>

<p>
"I want to marry the Emperor," answered the girl in
a sudden burst of fancy.
</p>

<p>
Because her auditors both laughed, Nancy obstinately
defended the absurd notion.
</p>

<p>
"When the Emperor sends to choose a wife, I shall go
to the palace, and then he will command me to be his
Empress, and I shall make Edward a governor."
</p>

<p>
"But he can't do that any more.  We have a republic
now.  And, besides, you are not a Manchu.  You are not
even Chinese; you are only English."
</p>

<p>
"That's all the better," said Nancy, "because if the
Emperor has an English Empress then all the English will
belong to him and he can use their guns to drive out these
republican barbarians."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's extravagant words had soon been repeated
through the household where they excited great merriment.
The women giggled at her temerity and nicknamed the
girl privately, calling her "Mock-Empress," a name of
which Nancy did not become aware till by her haughty
mood she provoked it from the lips of Li-an.
</p>

<p>
"You are nothing but a half-naked barbarian, you
mock-empress," exclaimed the half sister in anger.  "Do you
expect me to knock my head on the ground to you?"
</p>

<p>
Then the hair flew.  Nancy, her wrath swiftly wakened,
pounced on the younger girl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you shall knock your head," she cried.  With her
strong arms she bent Li-an to the earth.
</p>

<p>
"Knock, knock, knock," she shouted as she thumped the
head of her victim against the ground.  "Now you will see
if I am a mock-empress or not."
</p>

<p>
Edward intervened and Li-an fled screaming to her
mother, in whom the attack awakened all the old jealousy
of these children who carried themselves superior to her
own daughter.  The t'ai-t'ai went to see Herrick about the
affair.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy is growing up and getting silly notions," she
told him.  "Why don't you send her back to her own people?
A girl as big as she is should be engaged.  No one here
can control her."
</p>

<p>
Herrick listened in annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about these things?" he asked
testily.  "Don't I know what is best for my own daughter?
You take children's quarrels too seriously.  English girls
never marry so young.  You look after the behavior of
your own child and we shan't have these disturbances."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai took the rebuke in silence.  But she knew
as certainly as though he had spoken the words that
her English husband was only trying to conceal his
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
She had touched upon a sore spot.  If he had no plan to
suggest she must think of one, lest two foreign children,
like tiger cubs reared for pets, swallow their playmates of
the nursery.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Herrick decreed a retreat to the Western Hills.  Seldom
though he emerged from his dwelling, the man could not
escape the hubbub of a city which slept and prattled out of
doors.  The barking of mongrel dogs agitated him and made
him restless at night.  He wished a place where he could
think his troublesome problem to an issue, so his fancy
turned to the solitude of the hills.  He would carry off
Kuei-lien like a bride, take Nancy and Edward and the old
nurse, and leave the rest of the family to babble away
the summer in Peking.
</p>

<p>
The sister and brother heard the news with undisguised
joy.  They were more weary of Peking than their father,
for they had no change from the enclosed monotony of
the compound and were come to a restive age when their
limbs craved movement.  They wanted to walk and to
run and to gaze upon far-away sights with no high walls
preventing them.
</p>

<p>
They awaited with impatience the cool dawn when they
could climb into the mule cart and sit in high glee with
Kuei-lien squeezed tightly between them.  The cart began
jolting over the gritty surface of the streets, jarring their
bones despite the padding of the floor and the cushions
which were fastened to the framework.  But this they were
too excited to mind.  They only regretted the gauze curtain
which, by the strict orders of their father, had been
flung across the front of their hooded compartment.  Their
father, however, could not hinder their pushing the curtain
from side to side in their eagerness to observe to the
fullest the fascinating life of the streets.
</p>

<p>
Even at this early hour the market and the shops were
opening; trains of camels whose thick hair had fallen off
in patches were coming down the long street from Hsichih-men;
donkeys with bells jingling on their collars bore the
weight of fat travelers; Manchu women, so noticeable
because of their long gowns and enormous beetle headdress,
were stirring abroad; a princeling from the court of the
deposed Emperor rode past, followed by retainers; scarlet
plumes of horsehair flashed from their conical hats.
Nothing escaped the eyes of the children; even the humblest
shopkeeper taking down the boards from his windows won
their marked interest, and there was observant pleasure in
seeing the pavilions on Coal Hill, the turquoise and orange
roofs of which seemed to swim in the lucent mists of dawn.
</p>

<p>
The cart rumbled through a vaulted gate, skirted the
precincts of a railway station where the screeching engine
provoked an ecstasy of excitement in the hearts of brother
and sister; then came slow progress along willow-bordered
roads while the sun, growing hotter and hotter, beat down
through the blue hood of the vehicle, making Kuei-lien
sleepy, tired of her stiff, cramped position, anxious to
stretch and to yawn.  A stupa of many towers was left to
the south; the sombre ruins of the old summer palace were
passed and the splendid new palaces of the Empress
Dowager, which meet the fragments of Ch'ien Lung's
marvelous pleasure domes on the summit of Wan Shou Shan.
The children appreciated them all and looked eagerly at
the spire-like pagodas of the jade fountain and the
dilapidated buildings which were used to house tigers and bears
in the far-away time when Tatar princes followed the
chase.
</p>

<p>
Afternoon had come before the cart came at last to the
foothills.  The children climbed stiffly to the ground.  Nancy
hoped she might mount a sturdy little donkey for the
journey into the mountains, but her father would allow his
family to ride only in covered chairs.  Not without a
pouting of lips did Nancy obey, but soon she lost her
disappointment in the charm of scenes she had not laid eyes
upon for two long years, not since before the disastrous
days of the Revolution.  For the first time she was enjoying
the dignity of a chair to herself.  Hitherto she had been
huddled into the same narrow seat with Edward, but now
she could look elegantly from side to side through the
square windows, and see the plains recede behind the toiling
feet of the chair coolies, and Peking, with its towering
gates and golden roofs and graceful dagobas, filling the
horizon far beyond the palaces of Wan Shou Shan.  Suddenly
the girl grew inordinately happy.  She drank in the
ozone of the pines and looked down the steep slopes of the
gorge they were traversing till she felt as free as the water
that tumbled blithely across the boulders.
</p>

<p>
At dusk much climbing brought the chairs to the
secluded temple Herrick had converted into his summer
home.  Years ago it had been built on a small flat piece of
ground almost overhanging the edge of a ravine.  In the
old days its red-washed walls might have been conspicuous,
but trees had grown round it, a brake of hardy bamboo
hidden its entrance till the very bricks themselves
seemed to have taken root in their wild terrace.  The square
beacon tower which crowned the opposite ridge was so
desolate and forsaken, so obviously part of a world long
passed away, so remote from its time of flaming usefulness,
that it served merely to accentuate the loneliness of
the place.  The men it told of were men who never again
would buckle on armor and seize long spears at the news
of attack.  And the broken gods of the temple whom none
worshiped told in their decay the same tragic story.
</p>

<p>
Nancy hurried with awe through their midst and came
gladly to the courtyard she and Edward shared.  Oil lamps
gleaming through paper windows gave comforting assurance
of a supper hot and ready.  After all the changes
of the day the girl had begun to feel qualms of homesickness
for the noisy household in Peking; at sunset she had
grown sad, and now she wanted to shut out the magical
sound of the wind in the pines and the water pouring down
the ravine, for she was a little afraid of the loneliness.  She
longed for play and laughter and the shrill disputes of
concubines and servants.  She was sorry Li-an had not come.
She would have liked the agreeable relaxation of a quarrel.
</p>

<p>
The cheer of supper gave way all too soon to the able
terrors of bedtime.  Nancy lay awake for hours haunted
by the absence of all vocal sound; she tried to write in
imagination the most difficult chapters of the Four Books:
"i p'o, i hun, san tien"&mdash;she counted off the strokes and
shaded them gracefully in her mind or pulled them short
with the neatest of hooklike twists, but all to no avail.
The trees would not keep still; the maddening stream
would not cease running.
</p>

<p>
At last, in the panic of one who is seldom sleepless, the
girl got up.  She was envious of Edward's sound slumbers
and went cautiously to his room to awaken him.  To her
surprise the boy spoke before she had time to call him.  He
recognized her footsteps.
</p>

<p>
"I can't sleep," he complained in loud whispers; "let's
go outside or do something.  It's too quiet here."
</p>

<p>
Nancy told him in low tones to follow.  There was a
moon outside.  The two children looked like ghosts as they
moved with slippered feet across the rough marble
pavement of the courtyard.  The back door was unbolted and
slightly ajar so that its creaking was barely audible as
they slipped through.  They were in a weed-tangled grove
of young trees, but the few yards of path were easy to
follow.  Under the brow of the cliff which set definite limits
to the foothold of the temple they saw the tomb of some
forgotten abbot, a domelike structure with a ringed
pinnacle.  It was in deep shadow.  They gave an exclamation
of dismay and hurried to the side where the path led
up a short flight of steps to the top of the wall and ended
abruptly in a little rickety platform of wood that gave
high views of the ravine.
</p>

<p>
Nancy's heart was ripe for mystical adventure.  The
night was cool but she felt no bodily chill through her thin
garments.  She was inordinately sad, uneasy, desirous of
some change, some intrusion to match the hopeless beauty
of the night.  A waning moon, halfway done with its short
flight from mountain to mountain, illuminated the stream
far below and gave luminous surface to the rocks with its
tranquil light, but left the shadowy parts a pitchy blackness
which hid them like a veil.  Wistfully Nancy surveyed the
scene and looked at the crumbling watchtower on the
ridge opposite.  Her reading had made her curiously
unmodern.  Her thoughts dwelt on phantom armies of the
past, of princes masterly at falconry losing their way in the
wilderness, of old cries and alarms which she could not
reconcile herself to believing had long since ceased.  She
ached to help these poor lost mortals of the past, to be their
heroine, their desire.  How could she tell such dreams to
Edward, dear, stupid, faithful boy that he was?
</p>

<p>
"What can you see?" asked the brother, surprised at her
intent gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Lots of things," was Nancy's cryptic answer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's more than I can see."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you haven't my eyes."
</p>

<p>
Another fifteen minutes of this purposeless staring, this
obstinate silence, was all that Edward could bear.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to stand there looking at nothing all
night?" he demanded.  "I'm getting sleepy and, besides,
it's cold."
</p>

<p>
"Go in and sleep then," said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"I'm&mdash;I'm afraid," said the boy, after a moment's
pause.  "I don't like that tomb.  I don't like to go past it."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  If that's all, I'll take you past it."
</p>

<p>
Nancy took his hand and walked bravely down the steps.
</p>

<p>
"Look, I'm not afraid," she said when they reached the
grave, and she suited action to words by kicking the
unoffending sepulchre with her slipper.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" cried Edward, pulling her back.  "Aren't you
coming with me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not."
</p>

<p>
"You're not?" he echoed in amazement.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had a delicious feeling of terror in her own
foolhardiness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not ready to come yet."
</p>

<p>
Edward stopped for an instant, wondering if he ought
not to stay; then he turned and fled while Nancy, who
gladly would have followed him, tried to walk unconcernedly,
as though her heart were not pounding with fear,
back to the platform on the wall.
</p>

<p>
The moon had slipped out of view, letting the stars, now
unrivaled, come down to the very edges of the ravine.  The
slopes opposite were white and the watchtower suffused
by a weary brightness which showed every crack, the irregular
lines of every stone, like the wrinkles in the face of
an aging man.  But the shelf where Nancy stood was
steeped in blackness.  The girl was cold and miserably
afraid, wondering why she had not gone back with Edward,
for the tomb avenged her impudence by filling her
mind with ghostly fears.  Dawn seemed years away.  Nancy
imagined hostile shapes, things without heads, without
limbs, creeping down the cliff behind her.
</p>

<p>
And at the moment when the tension of her nerves was
intolerable she heard a noise, the sound of running feet,
a low laugh, a scuffle in the trees.  A heavy figure came
running up the path, up the steps.  The girl was too frightened
to jump; instinctively she shrank below the railing
of the platform.  But the moonlight had betrayed her;
she had been all too clearly outlined against the whiteness
of the hill beyond.  Suddenly she realized that strong arms
had seized her, and lifted her from her crouching position,
half torn the singlet from her shoulders in forcing her
round to meet the savage vehemence of a kiss.
</p>

<p>
To Nancy this swift shame was unutterable.  She had
the Chinese loathing of a kiss as a disgusting act suited
only to the dalliance of a brothel.  She fought like a maddened
lioness, scratching, biting, trying to claw the face of
her assailant, while the man, checked for a moment, since
evidently he had looked for complaisance, replied with
cruel fury, ripping her vest open to the waist, choking her
till the girl knew she was sinking hopelessly into submission.
Just when she had too little strength to know or care
what might follow she felt the arms of the man relax.
Someone, she did not know who, caught her as she fell
limp across the tottering railing.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" said a voice in English.  "It's Nancy!
And I thought it was Kuei-lien."
</p>

<p>
The voice woke the fainting girl more effectively than a
dash of icy water.  She stood up abruptly, still bewildered,
but understanding that the creature who had attacked her
so unreasonably was her father; that he had mistaken her
for his mistress.  A swift rippling laugh revealed the
presence of Kuei-lien herself, very much amused to see the
daughter involved in the amorous chase she had been
leading the father.
</p>

<p>
"You will be so boisterous, you clumsy fellow," she said
in tart Chinese.  "Fancy hugging your own daughter.  How
absurd!"
</p>

<p>
But the father was not amused.  He turned angrily to
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" he demanded of the girl,
who was trying to hold the torn fragments of her singlet
over her breast.  "What right have you to be spying on us
like this?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy had never been addressed in such harsh tones.
</p>

<p>
"I was not spying," she stammered.
</p>

<p>
"You were spying; don't contradict me.  You deserve to
be beaten for this.  Go on&mdash;get to your room.  You are
utterly shameless.  And you too&mdash;" he said sharply to
Kuei-lien, "you damned women are all the same, every
one of you."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
Nancy got away gladly; she stumbled quickly into her
room.  The episode had made a rent across her childhood
so that she could never again be the careless, innocent
creature she was.  The kiss was bad enough, an intolerable
defilement, but the method of the kiss was so beastly that
her mind had been wounded past the help of any quick
remedy.  Her part had been merely an accident; she could
not wash away, however, the uncleanness, the sense of
incest in the kiss she had received from her father.
</p>

<p>
She did not want the day to come now.  She had no courage
to meet the laughing person of Kuei-lien.  The concubine
very clearly was not embarrassed by the memory of
last night's mishap.
</p>

<p>
"What a laughable business," she cried, "to be kissed
by your own father!  And how angry he was!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you call it laughable?" asked Nancy solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!" said Kuei-lien, "don't take the thing so seriously.
It was just play.  If you choose to go mooning on
a dark terrace you can't blame anybody for making
mistakes.  It was funny the way you fought&mdash;and your own
father, too.  What romantic sensations you must have had.
Did you think the Emperor was kidnapping his beauty?
What a violent lover he must have seemed."
</p>

<p>
Nancy blushed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to talk about it," she said.  "It was
shameful."
</p>

<p>
"How innocent you are," said Kuei-lien, still unabashed.
"Shameful!  It was disappointing, I admit, but not shameful.
And such words from you, who have been so curious
about marriage.  How do you think husbands and wives
spend their time?  Writing scrolls, like you and Edward?
You can be as fine a poet as you please, my dear, and paint
charming pictures, and sit in a bamboo shelter with your
teacup and your flute and your ink-stone like the heroines
you read about, but your husband won't marry you for
those things.  He'll marry you for your face and your
body, for this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this&mdash;"  She touched the
girl playfully on her cheeks and shoulders and thighs.
</p>

<p>
"That may be the way barbarians marry," objected
Nancy; "that isn't our Chinese way."
</p>

<p>
"Our Chinese way!" Kuei-lien laughed.  "Our Chinese
way!  What are you?  You are not Chinese.  Aren't you
a barbarian yourself?  You are English, and that is the
English way."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?  You are not a wife.  You are only
my father's mistress.  Your experience doesn't prove how
a husband treats his wife.  You have to do these things;
that's what he bought you for."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's temper had got the better of her tact.  Yet Kuei-lien
controlled herself to a degree truly extraordinary for a
Chinese woman.  There was a dangerous flash in her eyes,
but the concubine was content to treat the remarks as the
petulant outburst of a child.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! you are younger than I thought.  You don't
understand.  Some day you will kneel to me for these
words."
</p>

<p>
There was a gravity in this last comment so unlike the
usual birdlike frivolity of Kuei-lien's that it left Nancy
very much shaken.  In her heart she recognized tacitly
that the other girl was right.  The episode of the night
had shown the great gulf interposed between Kuei-lien's
experience and her own.  It was true: she did not
understand.  Nancy began to distrust her own defiant protests,
the distinctions she had drawn between marriage and the
harlotry of concubines, and remembered a hundred hints
from the free-speaking women of the Herrick family,
things which she had apprehended in the figurative way of
a child.  She did not have the optimism of Western maidens
to help her.  Love was not bound up with the myth of the
"right man," so that Nancy, although in the first ardent
flush of youth, picturing imaginative romance with some
chosen stranger from that male world of which her father
and her brother were the only representatives she had seen,
had no real support against what seemed suddenly revealed
as life hopelessly ugly.
</p>

<p>
In a night Nancy had become a rebel.  But rebellion
gave her no relief because it offered no hope.  There was
no bold plan to perform.  Nancy never thought of escape
to the West because the West meant nothing to her but a
strange barbarous country with which she always was
angry to hear herself connected.  No taunt so roused her
as the name of Englishman.  The only fallacy she still
retained was her trust in the superior refinement of Chinese
ways.  She saw nothing absurd in saying, "our Chinese
ways," yet she and Edward were a race of their own, a
race quite unique, who were entitled, not like Eurasians
to the defects of two bloods, but to any advantage that
might be gained from being Western-born and Chinese-trained.
</p>

<p>
Even their father was excluded from these privileges.
He was an Englishman attempting imperfectly to assimilate
the East.  Nancy and Edward, without knowing it,
made allowances for his case, and, in the midst of being
fond of him, were subtly condescending over the little ways
in which he failed to adapt his mind and his body, just as
they remarked instantly the slight flaws, the little mistakes
of accent and grammar, in his remarkable use of Chinese.
</p>

<p>
When the girl heard the next day that she with her
brother had been summoned to an English class, she began
to bristle.  She went, of course, because she could not
throw off in a moment the thought that the will of her
father was law; nor could she alienate Edward's sympathy
by an attitude she was too embarrassed to explain.  But
she went, inwardly protesting.  Timothy Herrick was not
noticeably different in his manner.  He did not show,
perhaps, quite so much of the whimsical amusement he
usually evinced when glancing at his two sober little pupils.
Nevertheless he sat unperturbed and Nancy, while envying
his calmness, hated it.
</p>

<p>
His old friends would not have recognized their slim
debonair acquaintance of former years in the portly gentleman
who was presiding over this classroom.  There were
more alterations than dress could account for, more
alterations than the exchange of tweeds and flannels for
flowered silk could explain.  The Chinese dress with its
gown of pale blue silk and its jacket of cut velvet was the
more picturesque, but to those who had known the careless
elegance of the past there must be apparent a marked
falling off in pride of appearance, hints of slovenliness, in
proof of which it was hard, none the less, to cite any
convincing detail.  Nor could increased age explain why an
Englishman known for his alertness, his quick tact, had
given way to the heavy pompousness of the mandarin.
The rotund belly, the puffy cheeks, the bristling moustache
seemed to betray a man whose heart was cowardly, who
was trying to disguise by his bluff exterior the real truth,
that he had relaxed his standards and amended his life to
the pleasures that were easily obtained.
</p>

<p>
Nancy went through her lessons with an unobliging
surliness which Herrick could not but see.  He met his
daughter's defiance in the same spirit.  Herrick had been
autocrat so long that it was abnormally hard for him to see
mishaps from any side but his own.  He was angry and
aggrieved at last night's mistake, but more because it had
put him to ridicule than because he could conceive the force
of the shock to Nancy's pride.  It was preposterous to have
been fooled thus into kissing his own daughter; Herrick
was thoroughly annoyed by his own loss of face; but what
right had the girl to sit in judgment over her own father,
as she seemed all too palpably to be doing?  What right had
she even to think of finding fault?  His conduct was not
hers to criticize.  The kiss was only a kiss, nothing to her to
brood about; but her temerity in spying upon her father,
that struck at the very roots of obedience.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy, I have a few words to say to you," he said,
beckoning Edward to go.  The girl rose.  Herrick did not
like the candor of her clear eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Has your teacher taught you to stare at your father?"
he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked down, but not humbly.  Herrick surveyed
her with a curious detachment.  Ought she not to kneel,
he wondered&mdash;the precedents for Chinese behavior failed
him at times.  Perhaps it was enough that she should stand.
There was no harm, at least, in allowing a few moments of
silence to make his ensuing words impressive.  So he turned
to his water pipe and gurgled a few puffs of blue smoke
while the daughter remained in rigid but none the less
sullen attention.  At last the man ended the silence with
well-chosen Chinese phrases.
</p>

<p>
"I ordered your lessons this morning," he began, "because
I wished to see by your behavior whether you were
ashamed of the very great offense you have done.  For a
daughter to spy upon her father&mdash;that is unpardonable.
You are sixteen; I am fifty.  What I do is no concern of
yours; what I do you cannot be expected to understand.
Your place is in your own room at night; it is a scandal
for you to be anywhere else.  Yet I find you following me
around, causing me shame by your immodest curiosity;
and not only that, but all this morning you have sat here
stiff-necked, stubborn, seeming to reproach me, as though
I were answerable to you for my conduct.  What excuse
can you offer for your shameless behavior?"
</p>

<p>
"I was not spying," replied Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"You were not spying?  Then what were you doing
there at two o'clock in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
"I could not sleep.  I was looking at the moonlight."
</p>

<p>
To allow such an excuse would have undermined
Herrick's just cause for anger.  He could not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
"Who taught you to lie?" he sneered.  "I have no patience
with such nonsense.  Your business is to answer me,
not to argue with me."
</p>

<p>
Greatly restraining herself, Nancy said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you were spying," Herrick continued, "and
you haven't had the grace to be sorry.  Now, by way
of making amends, I want you to kowtow three times
to me."
</p>

<p>
"It is right that a daughter should kowtow to her
father," said Nancy simply, "but I am not sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Then you may stand here till you are sorry."
</p>

<p>
He had asked the impossible.  After two hours of silence,
during which the girl stood like a rigid statue, Herrick
realized that there was a sturdiness in his daughter's
nature which he might break but assuredly could not bend.
He began to admire the endurance of the child while
he grew more and more oppressed by the discomfort of
his own position.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that will be enough," he said, trying to gloss the
fact of his defeat, "I think you have learned your lesson
and have been punished sufficiently.  You needn't stay any
longer: you may go."
</p>

<p>
To his amazement, Nancy knelt down and bowed her
head to the ground three times.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry I could not obey my father," she said.
</p>

<p>
"What is the child!" wondered Herrick, when she had
gone.  "Just when I think she is hopelessly English, she
outvies the spirit of the Analects themselves.  Is she
English or is she Chinese?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
The answer was of such importance that Herrick neglected
Kuei-lien in his effort to find it.  Herrick's wrath
had gathered for a great outburst; and then Nancy, by
kneeling, by her sign of reverence for his position if not
for the man, had dissipated all the heaped-up vapors of
anger.  They had passed like summer lightning.  The man
grew sunny again.
</p>

<p>
Not for months had he shown such friendliness for his
children.  He took them walking, busied them collecting
flowers, led them up the heights of the opposite ravine to
see the desolate beacon tower.  Nancy did not talk much
on these excursions.  Her spirit was not yet at ease; the
rebellious impulses, however, sought outlet in the unusual
exercise.  They spent themselves, for the present, on the
hills which taxed her legs and revealed to her eyes so many
novelties of sight.  Edward, on the other hand, prattled
continuously, amusing his father by his voluble excitement
over every strange blossom and his certainty that every
cave contained a leopard or a tiger.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there's English in you, my lad," said the father
wistfully, "you ought to be playing cricket."
</p>

<p>
"What is cricket?" asked the boy, instantly curious.
</p>

<p>
"I'll show you," said Herrick, beaming from indulgent
memories of his own youth.  After searching out a clear
place, he constructed implements as primitive as they were
ingenious, a pitch of mountain turf cleared of boulders,
pine twigs for stumps, and cones for bails so insecurely
perched that the afternoon breeze put up the best of the
bowling.  Edward combined the conflicting duties of bats-man
and wicket-keeper while his father hurled large cones
down the pitch and Nancy, stationed in the slips, invariably
fumbled the rare ball Edward lifted in her direction.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed were the players in their very rudimentary
game that an unexpected cry of "Well hit, sir," burst upon
them like a thunderbolt.  Edward's desired tiger could
not have startled them more thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Nancy turned to run, but she saw her brother gazing
with wide eyes and open mouth till her own fear could
not keep her from seeking with half-averted face the
object of his astonishment.  She saw two men walking toward
her father.  They were not Chinese; that she knew
instantly, for they wore strange white helmets and shirts
open at the throat and short khaki trousers and thick
foreign boots.  They carried knapsacks and strange black
boxes such as Nancy, in her inexperience, did not recognize
as cameras.  Each of them swung a stout cane.  Could
they be bandits, Nancy wondered, her heart beating in
alarm; they looked extremely fierce.  Then she realized by
a flash of insight that she was seeing the spectacle she had
looked forward to&mdash;the spectacle of foreigners from the
mythical lands of the West.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," called out one of the two men, removing
his hat courteously and exposing a shock of blond hair,
"wanchee take picture, allee same photograph."
</p>

<p>
He had not realized that the three people he was
approaching were not Chinese.  Excited by observing what
unmistakably was a wicket, crude though it might be, he
thought he had stumbled upon some prototype of his own
national game being played by the aborigines of the
mountains.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it's been played since the days of Yao and
Shun," he told his companion; "nothing ever changes in
China.  Some dear old lady may find a new proof that
we're all descended from the Ten Lost Tribes.  I certainly
mustn't miss this picture.  Think how well it would look
in 'Leaves from an Archaeologist's Notebook' or, at the
worst, 'A Nomad W.G. Scores a Boundary.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's not a nomad nor a W.G. and I'm not sure
he's even playing cricket," said the other; "but don't let
small scruples interfere with your picture."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said the first, who was considering how he
might approach the game unobserved till Edward, catching
a cone in mid-flight and thwacking it back into the ravine,
provoked his shout of "Well hit, sir."  Nothing was left
except to walk forward openly in the hope that the three
strangely assorted players might prove amenable to his
wish.  So he shouted emphatically in the direction of
Herrick's portly figure, trying to check visible symptoms
of retreat.  "Just a minute, wanchee take picture, wanchee
take picture, one minute can do."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you?" inquired Herrick with the dryest of
accents.  "And to whom am I indebted for your acquaintance?"
</p>

<p>
The man stopped abruptly, while Herrick used the
chance to muster off his children.  Without further words
he went coldly by, as though he were passing two strangers
in the crowds of Regent Street, and the two children,
excited by this encounter, were too much afraid of their
father to give the men another glance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you make of that?" asked the astonished
intruder of his companion.
</p>

<p>
"You were right in one point, at least," said the latter,
"it was cricket.  But I don't think the knowledge is going
to help any dear old lady's theory of the Lost Tribes.  That
was certainly a stony British stare."
</p>

<p>
"And a stony British retort.  What on earth do you
suppose he was doing here masquerading in Chinese clothes?
And the girl and boy too?  They must have been English;
they weren't Chinese.  An uncommonly handsome girl at
that.  If I hadn't been paralyzed by the old gentleman's
answer, I should have taken a picture to prove we weren't
dreaming.  They might at least have stopped, and not run
away in this barbarous fashion."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but what an uncommon pair of fools we must
have seemed, shouting pidgin English at them!  No wonder
they were crusty."
</p>

<p>
Nancy and Edward knew the time was not opportune
for questioning their father.  But when they were home
again and safe in their own quarter, their tongues seethed
with comments on this meeting.  Kuei-lien and the old
amah joined in the discussion and were able to supply more
details about the men, who were members of a party,
it seemed, that was occupying a large bungalow in one of
the valleys some distance beyond.  It was a settlement, in
fact, to which foreigners came in the summer.  There were
women too, said the nurse, and girls dressed in foreign
clothes; "just like your mother," she continued, "but oh
no, not so beautiful, and not such splendid clothes."
</p>

<p>
She went into rapt ecstasies on the subject of Nancy's
mother, how she looked when the Admiral came, and what
she said, and the way she wore her jewels, till Nancy, who
had listened to these discursions many times and knew that
the garrulous record always veered round to distasteful
details of her own infancy, how she had given her bottle
to the dog or used the Consul's top-hat for a lavatory, cut
the nurse short by asking how she could get a glimpse
of these Western girls.
</p>

<p>
The amah looked suspiciously at Kuei-lien, whom she
did not trust.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm afraid your father would not like it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think he would mind, if you didn't boast
about it," interposed Kuei-lien.
</p>

<p>
"You ask him," said the nurse, scenting danger for her
children in the affable assurances of the concubine.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien and Nancy had not been cordial since the affair
of the kiss.  Kuei-lien had the long memory of her race,
a memory quite prepared to avenge insults on the third and
fourth generation if no earlier chance came, and she had
not forgotten Nancy's slighting words.  The score, in fact,
had been increased by the new kindliness between Herrick
and his children; this kindliness seemed to grow at the cost
of her own hold upon the father.  Since her ascendancy
began this had been the first falling away of Herrick's
affection.
</p>

<p>
The concubine, knowing too well the hazards of an old
man's fickleness, did not propose risking her mastery
merely to indulge the claims of two children.  With all her
bent for headstrong passion she was a cool creature,
resourceful, intelligent, able not only to captivate the heart
of her elderly husband by daring use of beauty, but to
calculate to a nicety the effects she meant to achieve.  She
wished place, position, power, desirable ends toward which
Herrick's infatuation could assist.  She knew the force of
the proverb that there is no fool like an old one and
played cleverly on its truth, that, when the time should
come, when Herrick had gone and her friend the t'ai-t'ai,
then the despised fifth wife should be enjoying the harvest
she had sowed.
</p>

<p>
But the place of Nancy and Edward in the household
economy had puzzled her.  They stood in the way of her
success, for, like all Westerners, they followed a disturbing
logic of their own and did not yield to the good old
precedents of the Orient.  She had not sat back with arms
folded, however, like the t'ai-t'ai, resigning the problem
to fate.  Fate was indiscriminate as lightning in the way
it struck, a very clumsy agent for nice ends.  Kuei-lien
believed in the art of directing fate, and now, after her
study of Nancy and Edward, she had come to one
certainty&mdash;that they must be returned to the West whence
they had come.
</p>

<p>
She was glad, then, to hear of their encounter with two
Englishmen.  Kuei-lien knew by hearsay the free and easy
intercourse by which Western men and maids fostered
romance; what she had learned considerably overshot the
mark, allowing it to seem all the more plausible that here
was an easy way for disposing of Nancy.  So she renewed
her friendliness with the girl, doing her best to laugh away
the morbid accident of the kiss.  Their relations were never
quite so comfortable as before; but the child was young
and excited by her first glimpse of two strangers, and she
was curious enough to hear eagerly all that Kuei-lien
suggested.
</p>

<p>
With Kuei-lien's encouragement it became a habit for
Nancy and Edward to go walking by themselves.  No one
had forbidden them.  Several days of rain and Herrick's
annoyance at meeting impudent intruders from his own
country had interrupted the father's inclination to stroll
with his children.  The nurse was busy managing the house;
because of her bound feet she could not have walked even
had she wished.  So the brother and sister assumed tacit
consent for little excursions to the bottom of the ravine,
whither Kuei-lien often went with them.  Very happy they
were to lie on the sun-baked rocks, where they could watch
the dragon flies skim between the boulders and could toss
leaves into the limpid pools of the stream.
</p>

<p>
These were mere short flights, a testing of the wings.
Kuei-lien pretended much interest in the place where
Nancy and Edward had met their Englishmen and when
she suggested going there she noticed the flush of color
which betrayed Nancy's own eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there are beautiful flowers there," said the
younger girl quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Aha, my child," thought Kuei-lien, "it's not the flowers
you will be seeking."
</p>

<p>
There were flowers in great abundance, harebells,
Michaelmas daisies, campanula, single larkspur velvety indigo
in color.  Of all these Nancy picked lavishly and then
piled her blue spoils on the grass where she knelt looking
at them, a little sorry because she had picked them and
could never give back the radiant lives she had taken.
</p>

<p>
"What lots of flowers you have plucked," said Kuei-lien,
smiling at Nancy's thoughtfulness.  "Are you glad?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nancy, "I am sad for them.  They die so
quickly."
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?  There will be hundreds more
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but not these."
</p>

<p>
"They give us happiness; isn't that enough?"
</p>

<p>
"I have picked too many," said Nancy; "one would
have given me happiness.  Oh, my flowers, my flowers,"
she cried, "I am sorry because I killed you!  One would
have given me happiness, yet I have taken so many."
</p>

<p>
Impulsively she turned to Kuei-lien with a serious look
in her dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all they live for, just to give us happiness?"
</p>

<p>
"Just to give us happiness," Kuei-lien echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Then to whom do we give happiness?  What do we live for?"
</p>

<p>
"We are flowers, too," laughed the older girl, amused by
the soberness of Nancy's question.  "We give happiness to
men."
</p>

<p>
Her reply was not meant to be flippant, but from Kuei-lien's
lips it came too truthfully.  It stirred in Nancy's
newly informed, her bitterly informed, heart a distaste for
her womanly fortune.
</p>

<p>
She looked down the rugged valley, saw the mellow colors
of the hills, a distant gleam of the plain, all suffused
through a patina of golden sunshine, and a shadow troubled
her youthful face at the thought that she could not
belong to these forever, that she could not be like the
yellow butterfly hovering above the flowers or like the
hawk Edward blithely was chasing, but must be cooped up
amid the tattle of women's quarters to give&mdash;the picture
stuck in her brain&mdash;to give happiness to men.
</p>

<p>
The unhurried tones of a bell sounded from some far
recess of the mountains.  Instinctively Nancy bent her head
to the ground.  Three times before her little heap of
blossoms she touched her forehead to the grass.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you doing that?" asked Kuei-lien in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I am worshiping my flowers," said Nancy simply,
"for I am going to be a nun."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Nancy's sincerity shocked her companion into silence for
the moment.  But it was not likely to be a long silence.
When they had shaken off the glamour of that golden
afternoon and walked moodily home, stilling even Edward's
chatter by a dumbness for which he could divine no reason,
Kuei-lien began to recover the spirits which Nancy's
perverse temper had dampened.  "A nun!"  The joke was too
good to keep.  Supported by the comfortable materialism
of the dinner table with its bowls of steaming white rice,
she could wax merry at Nancy's expense; the ghosts of
blue flowers could not enter here to throw their depressing
spell.  Kuei-lien was like a man who has been through great
fear and now tries to preserve the illusion of courage by
laughing at the meagre thing that had frightened him.
</p>

<p>
Edward readily became her ally and laughed louder than
any at his sister's new whim.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't eat any meat," he jested, pushing the
bowl of pork balls out of Nancy's reach, "and you must
shave your head.  Bring a knife, amah, and some incense
and we'll make her a nun now.  It will be lots of fun
burning the nine spots on her head.  Ah, but you will be
a pretty sight, Nancy, just like a bald-headed old woman.
When you come begging, we'll give you rice crusts.
O-mi-t'o-fu!  O-mi-t'o-fu!"
</p>

<p>
Nancy took his teasing good-naturedly, avoiding his
attempt to seize her hair and making a nimble raid on
the pork balls with her chopsticks; she was not yet
Buddhist enough to forgo the delights of meat.  She did not
even resent the aspersions uttered against her future
calling and listened composedly enough to tales about the
depravity of nuns.  They were all bad or ignorant women,
said Kuei-lien, and became nuns because their parents
were simpletons.  No respectable girl ought even to talk of
nuns, and if she became one her family could never lift
up their heads again, such would be the disgrace she had
brought.  The old nurse had her share to add to the bantering:
they were such dirty creatures.  How could they have
time for prayers when they were being consumed by
vermin?  And you can't kill the vermin, hai! that was
forbidden; you must let them eat till they were fat.  What was
the holiness of being eaten by bugs?
</p>

<p>
The old nurse had been contaminated by the Western
veneration of the bath.
</p>

<p>
Nancy listened to it all with the amused smile of one
who enjoys being the topic of conversation.  She was not
seriously touched by their dissuasion because her latest
ambition was still far from taking deep root.  Suddenly
attracted by the purity of heaven and earth and growing
things, she had put into words an unformed wish, but the
wish had no kinship to the sordid details of the dining-room
gossip.  There was momentary longing to be caught
up from the turmoil of humankind, but the longing did
not persist.  Nancy was glad enough to jest with Kuei-lien
and the amah, she needed the sight of Edward's cheerful
face and relished the savoriness of the evening meal.  It
was good to be well fed and comfortable, good to sleep
soundly in a warm bed.  So Nancy felt no urgency to
resist those who teased her, even though the impulse
remained more faithful than she guessed, a passion to
become one with the clean beauty of the sunlight and the
blue sky.
</p>

<p>
She went to bed happily tired, but a glimpse of the
stars, after she had puffed out her candle, was like seeing
a golden net overspreading the earth to make her dreams
captive.
</p>

<p>
Herrick alone did not ridicule Nancy's wish.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't she be a nun if she wants?" he asked
Kuei-lien, when the girl jokingly mentioned his daughter's
new ambition.
</p>

<p>
"You encourage a freakish ambition like that?"
exclaimed Kuei-lien, unable to believe her ears.
</p>

<p>
"I don't say I encourage it; I haven't thought of it
at all.  But if Nancy with all her heart chooses to be a
nun, I shouldn't stop her."
</p>

<p>
"Nuns are bad, dissolute women."
</p>

<p>
"Some may be, but not all."
</p>

<p>
"'Ten nuns: nine bad, and one mad,'" scoffed the
concubine.
</p>

<p>
"Are you happy?" asked the man, giving the argument
a disconcerting shift.
</p>

<p>
"Madly happy," Kuei-lien replied, hiding by a smile of
curious irony not only all signs that the question had
startled her but every hint as to what she meant by her
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am not, and I'm sure I don't wish to deny
Nancy her own way of seeking peace when mine has
failed."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien shrugged her shoulders over the bad taste of
such frankness.
</p>

<p>
"You take her child's notions too seriously," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but what am I to do with her?" inquired Herrick,
openly acknowledging his perplexity over the problem he
would not admit had been vexing him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you ask advice from the lowest of your servants?
Surely her poor wisdom cannot solve matters of such
difficulty."
</p>

<p>
Herrick knew that Kuei-lien was jeering at him behind
her studied modesty.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk this farcical nonsense to me," he cried,
brusquely impatient of the Eastern ways it had been his
habit to extol.  "If your poor wisdom is able to criticize
the girl's own plan, it is able to suggest something better."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't she marry?  No father who loves his
daughter neglects to have her married.  She isn't sick;
why should she be a nun?"
</p>

<p>
"Marrying is not easy and you know it.  Suppose I call
the matchmaker; what will she find for me?  Can she find
a son-in-law good enough for my daughter, a son-in-law
with the same learning, the same training?"
</p>

<p>
"That was your fault in wasting money to have her
taught."
</p>

<p>
"The money wasn't wasted.  That's not my meaning
at all.  What I mean is that families of her rank and
education will be afraid to betroth their sons to her
because she isn't Chinese.  Yet in speech and ways, even
in the color of her hair, she is as thoroughly Chinese as
any girl they could get.  Healthier too and better looking.
But the good families would be too conservative to consider
the match and even a swaggering squint-eyed upstart
of a returned student would think he was doing Nancy a
favor to be her husband."
</p>

<p>
"Why marry her to a Chinese?  Haven't you men in
the West?"
</p>

<p>
This was the obviously pertinent question Herrick
himself had been facing.  He made up for argument by an
outburst of temper.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think I have gone to all this trouble
these many years to have my children reared as Chinese?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," confessed Kuei-lien.
</p>

<p>
"Because the West has nothing but a beastly machine-ridden
civilization, nothing but thoughts of merchandise
and profit, fattening the bodies and thinning the souls of
its people.  A Westerner couldn't live in these mountains,
for example, without wanting to dam the stream and make
an electric plant.  He wouldn't see the color of the hills,
the light of the dawning sun shining on stones and trees;
he would suffer an unbearable itch to change them, to
make them useful.  Bah!  Every one of them is a materialist;
none of them know the finer relationships of life.  I
haven't brought up my daughter to be the wife of a bank
clerk."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Kuei-lien blankly, implying by her colorless
response to Herrick's enthusiasm that she considered him
a palpable fool.
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't destroy all she has learned," the man went
on, "I won't make her a Western barbarian by marrying
the girl to a man who can talk of nothing but golf and
horses and the fluctuations of rubber shares.  She would
much better be a nun.  Some day I think I shall divide
everything I own between you&mdash;that would be more
seemly than having the five of you fight for it after I
die&mdash;then I'll go into the mountains with Nancy and
Edward and enjoy a hermitage of my own."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go with you," mocked Kuei-lien.  "You won't be
happy without women in your hermitage."
</p>

<p>
"You'll go where the money goes.  I am too old to be
deceived by sweet phrases.  Any man can be let alone if
he is poor enough.  It is only the rich who are burdened
with women."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien was intensely amused by this expression of
contempt.
</p>

<p>
"What a funny man you are," she exclaimed, laughing
merrily, as she threw her arms round his neck in the
foreign way she had needed small prompting to learn.
"You are not a hermit yet; ai ya, you pitiable fellow, to
be so heavily burdened with women!"
</p>

<p>
Herrick, like Nancy, was content to postpone his dreams
of the monastery.
</p>

<p>
Not to forget them, however.  When a chance offered,
he called for Nancy in order to question her.  He had
never discussed marriage with the girl; it was not the
custom for a father to mention such subjects to his
daughter.  But to raise the question in English seemed
excusable.  So the man, seeking help from Nancy herself
on the difficult problem of her future, found she listened
decorously in the Western tongue to matters she would
have blushed to hear, had they been proposed to her in
Chinese.
</p>

<p>
"They tell me you wish to be a nun," said the father,
smiling while he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I made some undutiful remarks," acknowledged the
girl, afraid her father would laugh at the enormity of her
desire.  "I cannot go against my father's wishes."
</p>

<p>
"Very properly said," exclaimed Herrick, not really at
ease in his role of a Confucian father.  He had not been
born to it.  He could never quite believe Nancy's filial
attitude was genuine; the words, sounding so odd in
English, were like speeches rehearsed for a play.  He at
least was consciously theatrical, when he answered them.
"Very properly said," he approved, "but a father's wishes
are those which will make his daughter happy."
</p>

<p>
This was the way he expressed himself, solemn words
comporting the dignity of a parent, though what he really
would have given worlds to say was, "Kiss me, child; sit
on my knee, rub your hands through my hair, and let's
stop pretending we're grown-ups.  We've years before
we need bother over a frivolous subject like marriage."  Alas,
the Confucian canons did not permit such playfulness.
</p>

<p>
"I have been thinking about your marriage," Herrick
went on, stumbling pitifully for words after this regretful
glimpse of all the demonstrative pleasantries of affection
he had lost.  "It is time we considered these things."
</p>

<p>
Nancy became visibly paler.
</p>

<p>
"These are new times, new manners," he said, momentarily
homesick for the schooldays when he first learned
the phrase in its noble classical context&mdash;how long, long
ago that was!  Who would have thought he would be
quoting it to this strange dark-haired daughter!  "New
times, new manners.  Formerly we arranged these things
early"&mdash;he was the Chinese father now&mdash;"and we
looked for peace only when our daughters were safely
married.  We are a better generation, Nancy, better in a
few things at least, and we want peace for our daughters
too, not merely selfish peace for ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stood entranced.  She heard his slow words not
because they seemed to have any meaning but because
there was a grave rhythm to his speech which suggested
peace of another kind from anything the painful stumblings
of the human tongue could evoke; his speech went
with the drowsy sound of the pines, the noise of falling
water in the ravine.  Why knit the brows in a feeble effort
to conjure up peace when peace encompassed them, when
it folded them in the hypnotic embrace of the sunshine,
giving these transitory moments their eternal quality?
</p>

<p>
Herrick struggled to rouse himself.
</p>

<p>
"How shall we marry you, Nancy?" he asked abruptly.
"What kind of husband do you want: 'Rich man, poor
man, beggar man, thief'?"
</p>

<p>
What made that jingle come faintly back from the day
when he first learned it?  He really must stop this silly
habit of letting outworn, long-forgotten phrases run
through his mind.  It was childish.  "What kind of husband
do you want, Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
The question cut shabbily into the passionless quiet of
Nancy's trance.  The sunlight and the wind seemed to
have gone on and left her behind them.  All that lovable
outdoor world was receding as life itself might recede
from a dying man.  Frantic anxiety rent the girl's heart,
a wish to rush out and call on all these things to wait,
not to hurry so fast, lest she never again hear the birds
singing or play with Edward through the brilliant hours
of the morning.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of husband do you want, Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really want to be a nun?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
Not even that could she answer.
</p>

<p>
"It is very hard for me to decide," the father complained
gently enough, "unless I know what you do really
wish."
</p>

<p>
"I want to stay like this forever&mdash;forever!" suddenly
blurted out the girl, done with mild evasion, and
repeating the last phrase so that she surely must be
understood.
</p>

<p>
Herrick felt old.  The interview had sapped his blood
of its buoyancy.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if we could, if we only could," he muttered.  He
could hardly trust himself to look at Nancy.  She brought
to his mind the defiant beauty of her mother; it was no
use to-day trying to hold his mind back from rambling
through roadways of the past.  "No, Nancy, neither you
nor I nor anyone can stay like this forever.  I thought
I could once.  We grow up in spite of ourselves, child.
The happy times are just a day, a short day at that, and
then&mdash;finish."
</p>

<p>
The tension was eased by this last bit of prosiness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're not getting forward with our difficulty,"
Herrick was able to say in a more matter-of-fact voice.
"I won't ask you any more questions because I don't
think you know yourself what you wish.  I have just one
more thing I want you to do; I want you to bring me
the most precious thing you have, the thing you like better
than anything else, no matter what it is.  That will
help me."
</p>

<p>
Herrick waited curiously for his commission to be
performed and teased himself imagining what the girl would
bring.  He would know in what direction her fancy ran
more clearly than she could tell him.  "Butcher, baker,
candle-maker&mdash;"  How could he stop this accursed rhyme
from ringing in his head?
</p>

<p>
Nancy was gone a long time but at last she returned.
</p>

<p>
"What did you bring?" her father asked.
</p>

<p>
The girl held in her hand a flat object wrapped in silk.
She took off the covering and to his surprise Herrick saw
a little wooden tablet, carved and gilded, and so exquisitely
done he could hardly believe Nancy's confession that
she and Edward had made it.
</p>

<p>
"It is the spirit of our mother," she said in Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Herrick took the fragile object from her hands.  He
looked at the golden characters so faithfully written.
Their meaning he knew well enough, but his eyes seemed
too blurred to read the letters distinctly.  With great
difficulty he restrained himself from falling low before this
little thing of wood.  The task of deciding Nancy's fate
was too much for him.  He was tired.
</p>

<p>
"You are your mother's daughter," he said.  "Nancy,
Nancy, Nancy&mdash;I cannot choose for you."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Kuei-lien tried in vain to learn what had been said
between father and daughter.  She could get no clue.
Herrick smilingly told her that Nancy was too young to think
of marriage.  "We needn't bother about it till the time
comes."  She was afraid to ask open questions from the
child, who was mistress of a baffling, innocent reserve at
times, which outwitted the clever fencing of the concubine.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien was not idly curious.  Her acute instinct told
her plainly that momentous things had been said, things
closely concerned with her own fortune.  She read this
much in the faces of the man and the girl.  She read news
of defeat and was vexed to find herself worsted by an
enemy she could not circumvent.
</p>

<p>
Already it was August, the last sultriness of summer;
the terrific rains, which would not come again for ten
months, had poured down the mountain side and swamped
the plains.  Even the rockiest slopes were a lush green,
while camels, ungainly brutes in charge of little naked
boys who guided their movements with a well-aimed
pebble, had excellent pasturage at the foot of the hills.
The days would be clear now, but soon there would be
frost; the leaves of the maples would change color.
Herrick detested cold weather, would be restless for the
warmer comforts of town.  If there were to be any profit
from this solitary retreat to the mountains Kuei-lien
knew it was time to make haste.
</p>

<p>
She altered her tactics, recognizing now that the episode
of the kiss, laughable though it had seemed, had snapped
her hold upon Nancy.  So she diverted her attention to
Edward, who was a quick, lively youngster, ready to
venture forth and slay monsters.  The watchtower was
always a goad to the boy's imagination, making him aware
that he was treading the byways of an ancient hunting
park where the Tatar princes used to send swift arrows
to the heart of their quarry.  Edward prepared his own
bow and arrows while Kuei-lien stirred him to mimic the
exploits of his dead heroes.  He took advantage of
Herrick's nodding eye and wandered far afield, achieving
merciless execution upon the trees and stones which were
all these degenerate days offered in place of the tigers
and bears and antlered stags men once hunted.  He did
get one thrilling glimpse of a fox, which he magnified in
his excitement to a leopard, and he often twanged his
bow ineffectually in the wake of rabbits and pheasants.
His most vigilant guard, however, was against foreigners.
Against their approach he had built a little beacon tower
of stone, and he secreted dry sticks from the all-seeing
eye of the fuel-gatherer so that when the time came, when
alien hordes approached threatening from the West, he
could light a warning flame and save the golden roofs of
Peking!
</p>

<p>
Inevitably Edward pressed Nancy into his play.  What
was the good of a sister unless she lent herself to
something useful?  Nancy was quick enough to justify her own
usefulness and not content to take merely passive roles,
to be nothing better than the Mongol foe or the harassed
tiger, which Edward with traditions unconsciously
derived from the boys of his English ancestral country
thought a girl and a sister predestined to play.  The two
children climbed and played and quarreled and smiled
again and explored devious sheep tracks with a freedom
they had never known; they grew bolder and bolder in
the distances they ventured, plunging down the gravelly
paths before the sun was high and trying to outstretch
the light of the evening twilight.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien knew just how lengthy was the chase Edward
and Nancy were leading.  Stealthily she filled the boy with
the hearsay she picked up, the whereabouts of the
foreigners, how they had been seen roaming near the White
Horse Temple or the Clear Spring Pagoda, not only men,
but women and children, always seeking some far-away
place where they spread a white cloth on the ground and
sat down promiscuously to eat food from tins and bottles.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, when Kuei-lien held their father amused
and little inclined to disturb them with projects of his own,
Edward drew Nancy aside and whispered his plans for
the most daring raid yet projected.  He intended nothing
less than to scale the heights which overlooked the
summer village of the foreigners.
</p>

<p>
"I shall need all my arrows," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You can't shoot them," Nancy scoffed.
</p>

<p>
"I can shoot at them, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't ask me to carry the bow if it gets heavy."
</p>

<p>
Edward grunted amiably and led his sister through the
sleeping house.  An air of mystery came naturally to the
occasion, for he knew the expedition they were starting on
was not one to win the blessing of his father.  Walking
was hot so early in the afternoon, but the boy and girl
trudged forward valiantly, two slim figures in blue jackets
and trousers who startled an occasional wood-cutter, when
they stopped to ask the way, making him wonder what
part of the realms of Han produced such unusual faces.
</p>

<p>
"We can see them from there," said Edward, pointing
to a ridge of furrowed rock.
</p>

<p>
"Can we ever get to it?" asked Nancy.  "It seems days
away."
</p>

<p>
"Tired already?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was too proud to be outdone by a younger
brother.  She redoubled her efforts, hot and weary though
she was, and felt rewarded when they reached the remains
of an imperial hunting forest, a grove of stout pines
shimmering with silver bark, which thrilled the girl by their
stateliness.
</p>

<p>
"There is a temple," she said.  "Let's rest a few minutes.
Perhaps they will bring us tea."
</p>

<p>
"It's late," said Edward anxiously.  The ridge was still
a mile or two distant.  "We have to go back, you know.
We can't waste time."
</p>

<p>
But Nancy suddenly felt overcome by a thirstiness
which would yield to nothing but many cups of boiling
tea.  She hurried toward the red-washed walls of the
monastery, while Edward, whose conscience could not quell
his own thirst, followed only half unwillingly.
</p>

<p>
The temple was neither large nor beautiful, but it was
cool.  They passed the four monstrous figures of the
Heavenly Kings and threw barely a look at the fat little
Maitreya with distended belly, who sat in a glass case,
cheerfully oblivious of the scowling guardians of the
portal.  Beyond the first court with its iron incense-burner
a monk greeted them, uttering the mystical name, to which
they replied in his own words, "O-mi-t'o-fu."  He led
them to a table by the door and left them surveying the
gilded company of the gods while he brought hot water
to make an infusion of tea in the cracked cups.
</p>

<p>
"Oughtn't we to give him money?" suggested Edward.
"I didn't bring any."
</p>

<p>
"We'll bring it next time," said Nancy, determined that
nothing should stand between her and the tea she craved.
</p>

<p>
Edward, however, was too honest not to tell the monk
and was easier in mind when the latter deprecated all talk
of payment.  Another monk, fingering his beads, came and
sat down beside the children.  Nancy did not like him so
well; he showed brown discolored teeth when he laughed
and his eyes protruded like the eyes in the fierce images
behind him.
</p>

<p>
"You are foreigners?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Edward, scornfully, "we are Chinese."
</p>

<p>
The monk treated this as an excellent jest and repeated
it to his companion, as though Edward's fluent Chinese
needed translation.  He asked the other usual questions,
how old they were, who were their family, where they
were going, but to every word he gave an impertinent
accent which Nancy could not keep from resenting.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go," she said to Edward in English, "I don't
want any more tea."
</p>

<p>
"You are foreigners," exclaimed the monk in triumph,
convinced by this utterance of an unfamiliar tongue.
</p>

<p>
"We are not foreigners," Edward stoutly objected; "my
father is a Chinese official."
</p>

<p>
The man laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like him," said Nancy, again in English.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh," was Edward's response, "you can't expect
manners from a priest."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care.  I am not going to stay any longer.
We shall never get home."
</p>

<p>
Edward stood up too, apologizing profusely because he
had brought no money and promising faithfully that he
would recompense their trouble on his next visit.  The
monks would not hear of excuses; they would never have
considered taking money for so mean an act of simple
hospitality.  The boy, of course, knew their words were
spoken merely from politeness, but he felt so encouraged
by their affable courtesy as to inquire the shortest way to
the ridge they were seeking.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, from our back door it is only a few steps,"
replied his yellow-toothed host.  "I'll show you."
</p>

<p>
He preceded them round the three great Buddhas who
sat in repose on lotus flowers, stopping first to point out
to them the wizened embalmed figure of the holy man of
the temple, an old abbot whose sanctified flesh had resisted
the process of decay.  The children looked with awe at the
shriveled body over which a cloak of faded red satin had
been thrown.  Its clawlike finger nails, the sparse hairs
protruding from the gilt which did not hide the wrinkles
of the face, the puny withered legs on which the dead
man sat, reminded them of a monkey profanely set up
beneath a canopy of gold and scarlet.  The sight filled them
with horror.  Nancy gladly hurried into the courtyard
beyond and followed the direction the monk pointed while
he waited for Edward, who wanted one more look at the
hideous corpse.
</p>

<p>
She passed through a door, took a step or two, then
paused in alarm.  This was a room, not a passage.  She
must have taken the wrong turning.  Before she had
sufficient presence of mind to go back, she heard a
grating noise and wheeled round just in time to see the
grinning lips of the monk as he slammed the door in her
face.  There followed a creaking of wooden bolts.  She
dashed frantically to the door, but, as she anticipated all
too correctly, it would not yield.
</p>

<p>
For the moment she was too much frightened over what
might be happening to Edward to consider her own peril.
She heard his voice crying shrilly, "What have you done
with my sister?" then the voice of the monk grunting,
"Catch the little rat."  After this came noise of a scuffle
and an exclamation of pain, then some cursing which
seemed to show that Edward had outwitted the man who
was trying to capture him.  The noise went with a rush
into the hall beyond so that Nancy, whose heart was
beating tumultuously, could not follow the further
fortunes of her brother.  She was in an agony of fear for
his safety and looked wildly round the room to see what
she could do.  There was the first and obvious precaution
of drawing the inner bolts of the door so that she was
secure for the present from any but a violent attempt
to break into the chamber.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Edward had done well.  The instant
he realized the evil purpose of the monk he had drawn
his bow tight, suddenly glad and proud of the weapon
Nancy had derided.  When the monk rushed forward to
seize him, Edward had let his arrow fly, catching his
adversary a blow in the pit of the stomach which effectually
checked the attack.  The man took some seconds to regain
his breath.  They were enough for Edward to run swiftly
across the courtyards to the outer hall of the temple where
the other monk was still fumbling with the gates.  He
was too slow.  Edward eluded him and dashed down the
path till after a flight of several hundred yards he realized
no one was pursuing.  Then he paused.  The exhilaration
of his doughty resistance forsook him.  He wanted to
boast to Nancy about his prowess as a marksman; he had
vanquished a real enemy.  But there came the stupefying
memory that Nancy herself was in great danger and that
he must save her.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was not only in great danger but sadly depressed
by the quiet which ensued upon Edward's escape.  She
did not have even the comfort of knowing that the boy
was free.  The sound of excited voices came from a distant
part of the monastery but no clue to what had happened.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked anxiously about her prison.  It was a
bare, whitewashed room, fortunately with only the one
door, but also without a vestige of furniture which could
help her in climbing to the high square windows.  She
tried jumping in hope of grasping the wooden frame, but
the effort was too great.  Her hands slipped uselessly down
the rough tiles.  After wearing herself out in frantic leaps,
she sat down exhausted on the floor, sobbing convulsively
as she realized that her only chance of escape depended
upon Edward&mdash;the possibility that he had been more
successful and got away to call help.
</p>

<p>
This passive ordeal was heart-rending, for Nancy had
ample time to remember all the tales of monks and their
evil doings, which the women of the household were wont
to relate with much gloating zest.  She was under no
illusions about their lust, their greed, their cruelty, their
perverted ways.  She had heard too many stories about
young girls kidnapped and held in lewd bondage while
their families searched for years, unable to secure any
hint of where they had been taken; she knew too that
these lonely monasteries often were the haunt of bandits
who recruited their wives from the guileless women who
came to worship; they were places where rascals hid
children while they extorted ransom from wealthy parents.
Only the other day Nancy had been told of a boy whose
ears had been cut off and sent by post to his parents to
hurry payment of the money the robbers had demanded.
Would they treat Edward this way?&mdash;or herself?
</p>

<p>
She tried to avoid pondering the details of her own
fate, but she could not blot them out of mind.  She would
not yield, she vowed, but she guessed the ruthless torturing
ways of these men when they wished to bend a handsome
girl to their will.  In a spurt of energy she jumped up
to examine the fastenings of the door.  They were strong.
She took off the garters of brilliant orange elastic which
she used, like modern Chinese girls, now that the fad of
silk stockings had ousted the old foot wrappings.  If the
worst came to the worst she might be able to hang
herself from the bolts on the door; alas, her experiments in
the performance of suicide were not very convincing:
the garters were too short and if she used the string
which held her trousers in place she might practise too
successfully and give finality to a rehearsal which was
meant to be tentative.  Yet the interest of examining the
articles of her clothing for their possible use in suicide
had the paradoxical result of cheering the girl and diverting
her from the extreme depths of morbid terror.  It was
like planning a game to think how self-destruction could
be effected by the limited means at her command.  Nancy
became more light-hearted over the problem of this
danger which had swooped down so unexpectedly from the
gayety of a summer stroll.  The temple, at all events, had
relapsed into quiet.  The girl's courage was not put too
quickly to the crisis of defending her door.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Edward's elation vanished when he thought of his sister
shut helplessly in the temple from which he had got free.
He stood irresolute, unable to think.  Then he realized
that Nancy's safety depended upon him.  But there was
no vigorous response of energy because he knew, if he
ran the whole distance home, Nancy might be ravished
and murdered or carried far into the mountains before he
could bring help.  To go or to stay, the question daunted
his powers of decision.  But he felt, after a mental debate
which seemed to protract minutes to hours, that he must
know something more of what was threatening Nancy.
</p>

<p>
Warily he grasped his bow and tiptoed through the
trees toward the monastery.  He listened like a scout for
every sound.  The crackle of twigs beneath his own feet
set his heart beating.  He came at last to a place where he
could survey the front of the temple.  The gates were shut.
Birds screeched in the trees above him but not a murmur
issued from the building.
</p>

<p>
Edward was perplexed.  The silence frightened him.  He
went cautiously round to the side.  In this direction must
lie the room into which he had seen Nancy disappear.  But
the temple was like a fortress; its tall vacant walls mocked
scrutiny.  There were a few windows at the back, but
too high to be reached without a ladder.  He dared not
come close enough to stand beneath them and call for
Nancy.  There were the trees, however, and they suggested
the expedient of climbing, a feat for which the boy was
thoroughly adept.  He scaled a smaller pine and swung
himself, despite the entangling encumbrance of his bow
and quiver, into one of the lower branches of a gigantic
silver-barked tree which he realized, with a thrill of joy,
must overlook the courtyards of the temple.  Higher and
higher he climbed, happy to be active; the strong boughs
were like steps.  But when he got far above the ground
and could look down upon the walled buildings he saw
nothing that could tell him what had become of Nancy.
The courtyards were empty.  They had the vacant look
of a deserted place.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the monks had run away, he thought; perhaps
they had carried Nancy with them.  They had not
intended him to escape, that was certain.  Their plans had
been so sure that Edward hoped the accident of his
slipping free from the trap, the knowledge that he would
expose their knavery and was summoning help, might
have driven the frustrated monks into flight.  Edward
decided on greater risks.  He climbed back to the earth
and walked softly across the open space till he stood
beneath the first window.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," he called carefully.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
He called again.  Still no answer.  The white paper which
filled the tiny square panes gave blank response to his
whispered cries.
</p>

<p>
He moved on to the second window and repeated his
call.  Just as he was on the point of trying the next, he
heard a faint "Yes."  He could hardly control himself
for joy.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Nancy?" he whispered in English.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"This is Edward.  I got away.  Are you all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Can you get out?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the windows are too high.  I haven't anything
to stand on."
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Have they tried to get in?"
</p>

<p>
"No, they haven't made a sound for a long time.  And,
besides, I've locked myself in."
</p>

<p>
"I think they've run away.  Don't be afraid, Nancy.
I'll get you out.  Shout if you hear them."
</p>

<p>
Edward scarcely could contain his feelings of relief.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the cover of the trees, he stepped slowly
round to the back.  There he stopped.  The little back
gate of the temple was open.  He must have guessed
correctly: the monks had fled.  The boy would have thrown
caution to the winds and rushed to the door if some
whispering sense of discretion had not restrained his
movements, causing him to turn in bare time to see a
gray cloak withdrawn behind a neighboring tree.  Edward
stopped still in alarm, then he gave a shriek of fright and
took swiftly to his heels as the monk abandoned his futile
ambush and came thundering in pursuit.  The other monk
emerged from the door within which he had been hiding
and joined in the chase.
</p>

<p>
Edward ran as he had never run before, throwing
away his bow in his haste and tearing madly past the
front gate of the monastery.  The men behind him were
fast.  He dared not turn his head to see if they were
gaining, but he knew this time they were staking all on his
capture.  They must catch him and close this one mouth
which could babble their secret.  They were desperate men;
if Edward's powers of endurance were trebled by fear,
their own fleetness of foot was enhanced not only by
the sense that Nancy was the prize of their victory, but
also that the loss of the monastery where they had lived
might be the price of defeat.
</p>

<p>
But the race was never run to its finish.  Before he was
aware of approaching them, Edward, scampering madly,
head-down, had crashed between the burly figures of two
men.  Cold with dismay, certain that he had been intercepted,
he was trying to shake himself free from the hand
which detained him when he heard a voice exclaim in
English:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Slowly, slowly, my lad!  What's all this about?"
</p>

<p>
For the first time he looked up to see with amazement
that he was not in the hands of ill-met friends of the two
monks, but held by the very two foreigners who once
had applauded his cricket; he was a captive of the Western
barbarians whom, in his mock wars, he had been
defying&mdash;and very happy to be their captive after the real
warfare of this unlucky afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"My sister!" he cried.  "They have got her up there."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the monks, who had stopped, evidently
chagrined by this new turn of affairs.
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said one of the men, who had a vivid memory
of Nancy's beauty.
</p>

<p>
"In the temple," said Edward breathlessly; "they want
to make her their slave."
</p>

<p>
The men chuckled, despite themselves, at Edward's
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"They look like a harmless old pair," said the second.
"I shouldn't accuse them of being so naughty."
</p>

<p>
He approached the two monks and tried to address
them in none too fluent Chinese.  But the yellow-toothed
priest, who had picked up pidgin English in a temple at
Peking where the increase of tourists made it both
profitable and necessary for him to express his importunity
in terms his visitors understood, now interrupted the
foreigner.
</p>

<p>
"Him b'long plenty bad boy," he said, pointing an
accusing finger at Edward; "his sister plenty bad girl.
Drink much tea, no pay money.  So lock up, wanchee make
pay money."
</p>

<p>
The foreigner smiled to see Edward's blank look at
hearing this unfamiliar idiom.
</p>

<p>
"You availed yourself of this gentleman's hospitality,
my young sir, without making due recompense, and he
has gone to the extreme length, rather too extreme I
admit, of locking up your sister.  Am I stating the case
correctly?"
</p>

<p>
The boy looked even more amazed.  This was a tongue
far beyond the bounds of his comprehension.  The man
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Well, never mind, I don't think there's anything worse
than a twenty-cent piece at stake.  Follow me and we'll
soon have your sister out of the dragon's clutches."
</p>

<p>
Edward divined that his intentions were helpful.  He
himself was too fully charged with emotion to take up the
task of explaining their adventures in English.  He was
content to walk quietly between his two new friends, glad
of their protection, even ready for the moment to overlook
the impudent defense of the priest.  The other monk
had slipped away during their colloquy and had made
good use of the few minutes thus gained, for the little
party, when they arrived, found the front gate opened and
their host prepared with a kettle to pour out more tea
for his visitors.
</p>

<p>
"No, we must release the beleaguered damsel first,"
said the Englishman.  "Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
The older monk, understanding his gestures, led the way
to the door behind which Nancy was confined.  It had been
unbolted too and plausibly confirmed the monk's tale.
</p>

<p>
"He much frightened.  No come out."
</p>

<p>
The man felt the door which Nancy was still keeping
securely fastened.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, she doesn't trust you ecclesiastical gentry," he
said.  "Call her, my lad; tell her she's safe."
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," shouted Edward in Chinese, "it's all right
now!  You can open the door.  There are two big foreigners
here.  The old turnip doesn't dare hurt us."
</p>

<p>
The monk gave Edward a wicked look.  The boy rejoiced
to see that his thrust had gone home and referred
to the priest in several other terms of choice abuse, a
partial revenge which his enemy had no means of countering.
The Englishmen stood innocently by, unconscious of
how Edward was settling scores with the monk, till at
last the grating of bars told them that the prisoner was
reassured.  The door opened and Nancy stood before them,
white and startled.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Neither man forgot this picture of Nancy in the doorway.
The quick look of surprise she gave them was not
swift enough to banish traces of the terror she had been
suffering, so that they cherished a continuing memory of
the color in her startled eyes before she looked down,
confused by the gaze of two strangers.  And her blush of
embarrassment was too slow to hide the glowing whiteness
of her skin, a whiteness accentuated by the sumptuous
disorder of dark hair.  The girl kept a nervous grip upon
the panels of the door; she stood tiptoe, her body poised
for flight; the narrow slope of her shoulders, the fullness
of her thighs, the slender ankles, to which the simple
costume of jacket and trousers did admirable justice,
suggested a figure graceful rather than dainty, a healthy
coherence of nerves and muscles ready to express with full
pliability the lightest promptings of her mind.  She was a
creature through whose veins life ran bravely.
</p>

<p>
Not till Edward took his sister affectionately by the
hand did she relax.  One of the men, at least, watching the
haunted look slowly subside from her face, realized that
the boy's story, after all, had not been so wildly unlikely:
there had been more at issue than payment for a cup of
tea.  His suspicion would have been amply confirmed if he
had seen the greediness in the face of the monk, a stare of
thwarted exasperation which a lifetime of copying the
placid Lord Buddha did nothing to erase.  Nancy saw it
and turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, tea has been your undoing, my children," said
the more whimsical of the two Englishmen, "now let tea
make amends.  Sit down and let's drain the pot.  I've
got twenty cents for your ransom and twenty cents more
for ours, so have no fear.  They can hardly lock up the
four of us."
</p>

<p>
Nancy would not think of drinking more tea beneath
this hostile roof, but Edward, quite at ease again, poured
several cupfuls down his thirsty throat.  The two monks
were bland and smiling and did their amiable share in a
disjointed, bilingual conversation with the two strangers.
The children they ignored, but Nancy stiffened each time
they passed her stool and waited anxiously for her rescuers
to finish.  At last, after one of the Englishmen had done
the rounds of the temple, examined the eighteen Lo-han,
photographed Kuan-yin on her dolphin, and tried various
expedients, all useless, to photograph the mummy in his
glass case, they got up to go.  With effusive bowing they
passed out of the monastery from which, an hour ago, she
had nearly lost hope of escaping.  Her happiness to be
away from its walls made her forget for a moment how
low the sun had fallen.
</p>

<p>
"We haven't introduced ourselves," said the man who
had been taking the lead.  "My name is Beresford and
my silent friend here does honor to the good old name of
Nasmith.  May we presume to ask what you are called?"
</p>

<p>
"Edward," answered the boy; "Edward and Nancy."
</p>

<p>
"Good names, too, good old-country names; but have
you not a surname, a last name?"
</p>

<p>
It took Edward a minute to realize that the man meant
what would be, in the Chinese order, his first name.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is Hai."
</p>

<p>
"Hai?" repeated the man.  "But that's Chinese.  What
is it in English?"
</p>

<p>
Edward did not know.  "Hai" always had sufficed.
</p>

<p>
"We can't call you Miss Hai and Master Hai," laughed
Beresford; "that would be absurd.  If you will forgive the
impertinence, we must content ourselves with Nancy and
Edward.  What is your father?  Why does he dress you
like this?  Is he a missionary?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Edward.  "He is an official of the
Emperor, that is, he was an official of the Emperor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"When there was an Emperor," helped out Nasmith,
relieving the boy from possible difficulties with his syntax.
</p>

<p>
"But your father is an Englishman," said Beresford,
mindful of the stony British stare.
</p>

<p>
"No, he is a Chinese official," protested Edward.  "He
used to be an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
The men exchanged curious looks.
</p>

<p>
"And your mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Our mother was English.  She's dead."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the man, fearful lest he had touched a sore
spot, but ready to proceed with his questions when he saw
by the slight boastfulness in Edward's bearing that the
death of his mother was a claim to distinction rather than
a recent sorrow.  "Then whom do you live with?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we live with father and the amah and Kuei-lien&mdash;that's
my father's newest wife; she's very pretty.  That's
all there are here.  The rest are in Peking, the t'ai-t'ai and
the other wives.  Then I have some brothers and sisters
in Peking too, but not real sisters like Nancy."
</p>

<p>
The two strangers heard this domestic record with
astonishment, not the smallest cause of which was
Edward's matter-of-fact tone in the telling.  They had come
leisurely through the silver pines to the end of the temple
path.  Suddenly Nancy, who had taken no part in the
conversation but walked on Edward's far side, began speaking
to her brother in swift low Chinese.  The reaction from
her peril, the novelty of walking with two foreign men,
neither of them could blind her to the lateness of the
hour.  Once out from the shadow of the trees, she realized
night would fall long before she and Edward could get
home.  Another spell of panic unnerved her.  Edward
himself looked round with an expression of blank dismay.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith perceived the trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you live?  Near where we saw you playing
cricket?"
</p>

<p>
"Farther, much farther."
</p>

<p>
The man whistled.
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't get halfway there before dark, even if
you know these goat tracks, which I don't believe you
do, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," admitted the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Neither do we.  We might wander all night.  We
certainly should not think of your going alone.  I'll tell
you what you can do: you come home with us for the
night.  We're quite respectable; don't be alarmed.  My
married sister is there with her children, quite large
kiddies, your own age in fact.  She can squeeze you in, I know,
and then to-morrow morning we shall make it our first
duty to see you home."
</p>

<p>
"But father will not know where we are," said Nancy
doubtfully.  "He will be angry."
</p>

<p>
"He will be worse than angry if you are lost, Miss
Nancy, and I see no hope of our finding the way there at
this time of day.  At home, perhaps, I can find a messenger
who can take a letter to him.  That will keep him from
worrying."
</p>

<p>
Edward seemed eager to accept the invitation, but Nancy
still hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Don't fear, Nancy," said Beresford kindly, divining
her fears; "in any case we are not going to desert you.
If you say the word, we'll try to get you home to-night,
though I don't think it can be done.  If you come
home with us I can assure you of a merry time.
Mr. Nasmith's sister's children&mdash;excuse the mouthful&mdash;are
really very jolly and full of fun.  You mustn't judge
them by their uncle.  You will have the time of your life,
and nothing will please them better than to have two
visitors.  They'll want every last word of your adventure.
What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy saw the reasonableness of what he said and she
liked the jovial courtesy of the choice he allowed.  She
was shyer than Edward, but already she felt as if she had
known these men&mdash;she did not think of them as young
men; they represented no special age to her mind&mdash;she
felt as if she had known them for years.  And she trusted
them.  So to Edward's manifest joy she put aside qualms
about her father's wrath and chose an experience which
promised entry into a new world, a world she had long
been curious to see.  She was tired too and hungry, and
this walk, as it proved, was none too short for the hour
of daylight which remained.
</p>

<p>
Beresford had extracted a fair knowledge of Edward's
history by the time they reached the settlement.  He had
learned to suppress his amazement and relished with
appreciation every sidelight of Edward's intimate recital.
It was rare amusement to hear a youngster, who was so
assuredly English as to regret the loss of his bow more
than all the excitement of a crowded afternoon, treating
of concubines, their favor and loss of favor with his
father, their expectations of further offspring, as though
these were the normal stuff of life.  Nasmith did not say
much, but he listened with silent appreciation while Nancy
walked quietly, obsessed by thoughts no one could read.
</p>

<p>
They came at last down a wide road into the settlement.
Dusk had fallen.  The children were dazzled by the
many lights which shone from the bungalows and from
the occupied temples scattered round the sides of the
valley.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here we are," said Beresford, passing through a
grove of acacia at the end of which stood a low, rangy
house, built in foreign style.  An oil lamp, hanging from
the ceiling of the verandah, shone upon a table where
dinner, it seemed, was soon to be served.  Servants were
spreading a white cloth.  Nancy, with a sinking of the
heart, recognized that several people&mdash;they looked like
a crowd to her frightened eyes&mdash;were sitting in a group
just beyond the outer margin of the light.
</p>

<p>
"So you're back, are you?" came a woman's voice.
"We were just going to have dinner without you.  Why,
whom have you brought here?"
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to be late," laughed Beresford, as he stepped up
to the verandah, "we've found the Babes in the Wood and
brought them home with us.  Nothing to be afraid of,
Edward, Nancy," he said, pushing the children into the
light, "she won't bite.  Miss Hai, Master Hai, in other
words, Nancy and Edward, I have the pleasure of
presenting you to Mrs. Ferris.  Tell the rest of the family
to sit down; I'm not going to introduce them now.  This
isn't a reception.  Take this pair inside, Agnes, and let
them wash.  Ronald will explain."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferris was not so puzzled as to miss the hint.
She saw the embarrassment of the two children; her
motherly sympathies helped her to take instant pity on
their plight.  She got them inside, called for hot water,
soap, and towels, and left the boy and girl vigorously
scrubbing themselves.
</p>

<p>
"They know how to wash," she said delightedly, coming
back to the large living-room.  "Who are they?  What
are they?"
</p>

<p>
Nasmith detailed all that he had learned while
Beresford was supplying the curiosity of the group on the
verandah and keeping them from too quick a descent
upon Edward and Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"The poor dears!" exclaimed Mrs. Ferris.  "How utterly
horrible to think of two English children being brought
up like that!  And with such a man for their father.  I
declare I don't think you ought to take them back."
</p>

<p>
"They don't see the horror of it at all, you can count
on that, Agnes," said Nasmith, not wishing to smile too
openly at his sister's point of view.  "They won't find it
half so horrible as wrestling with forks and knives at
dinner to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I can borrow some chopsticks from the servants."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, the experience will be a thrilling one for them
to remember.  This will be their first introduction to
foreign ways.  The more highly colored the impression the
better they will like it."
</p>

<p>
Nancy and Edward were called into consultation for the
dispatch of a messenger to their father; then they were
ushered into the room, where they stood shyly, not daring
to take note of their surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"You must make yourselves at home," said Mrs. Ferris
gently.  "I am awfully glad my brother brought you here.
We'll take good care of you and see that you get back
to your father safely.  I'll call the children now; they are
dying to meet you."
</p>

<p>
Nancy had only time enough to notice her pleasant face
and the oddness of her light wavy hair&mdash;it seemed rather
untidy to the Chinese taste in the way it was heaped on top
of her head&mdash;before the children trooped in.  She did not
wish to stare too curiously, but her interest in seeing
Western girls for the first time directed her eyes with
irresistible fascination toward the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
"These are the twins, Helen and Elizabeth," said
Mrs. Ferris, as two girls of Nancy's own height came forward.
Each of them stretched out her hand, momentarily puzzling
Nancy, who had forgotten that this was the foreign
way of greeting.  She tried to make up for her lapse by
hastily putting out her left hand, so that her new friends
in their turn were nonplused till frank laughter on all
sides set matters right and helped Nancy to feel more at
ease.
</p>

<p>
The girls saved Edward from accident by merely
bowing.
</p>

<p>
"This is David," continued the mother, introducing a
boy of twelve, who grasped Nancy's hand warmly before
she had time to be perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"And this is Patricia."
</p>

<p>
A bare-legged girl of ten came forward.
</p>

<p>
"And last but not least&mdash;are you, my darling?&mdash;Reggie,
the baby."
</p>

<p>
He was a chubby youngster of six.
</p>

<p>
"So you see we're not a small family, nor a quiet one,
either.  How old are you, Nancy?  You must be about the
same age as the twins."
</p>

<p>
"I am seventeen," Nancy answered, finding it difficult
to speak English before so many strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Seventeen!  I should not have thought it.  I suppose it's
your costume which makes you seem younger.  Why, you
look almost like a boy.  Then you are older than my
girls."  Mrs. Ferris did not know that Nancy was figuring her age
by the Chinese reckoning, which makes a child one when
it is born and two on the succeeding New Year's Day, so
that a baby born on New Year's Eve can be two years old
before he has lived two days.
</p>

<p>
Older though she might be, Nancy felt very young
beside these two strapping lasses, who were so instantly
friendly that she was no longer afraid to look at them.
For twins their features were not much alike, but they
had the same yellowish golden hair, which they allowed to
fall profusely down their shoulders.  Nancy had never
seen this fashion before; it was strange, but she liked it.
The color too was unusual, but not too freakish in Nancy's
eyes, for she was used to her father's shock of light hair.
The blue eyes did startle her, but the girl was more
entertained by the dresses they were wearing, dainty white
muslin which left throat and shoulders bare and spread
out into many embroidered flounces at the knees.  This was
the foreign style, no doubt, but it did not appear quite
modest.
</p>

<p>
Dinner offered formidable difficulties of its own.  Nasmith
secretly had prompted the family to talk and laugh
in their usual manner so that their guests might not suffer
too self-consciously from the ordeal.  The hint was well
taken, but Nancy and Edward could not wholly escape
the interested surveillance of their neighbors.  They were
proud children, furtively careful how they dealt with
knives and forks, not willing to disgrace the family name
by even pardonable mistakes.  But Edward fared better
than his sister.  He had been put at the right of
Mrs. Ferris, with whom he was soon on easy terms in his eager
boyish way, and he benefited by the little mannerly
explanations of his hostess, words so delicately put that he
did not know he was being instructed and enabled to
relish the unfamiliar dishes.
</p>

<p>
The experiment of putting Nancy on Nasmith's right
proved unfortunate.  The girl could not accustom herself
to sitting next to a man; it was too great a breach with the
past.  And even her hunger could not override the peculiar
flavor of the food.  She tried courageously to sip three
spoonfuls of tomato soup; the taste balked her.  She was
more conservative than Edward.  She held her knife stiffly
and sawed ineffectually at the meat, just checking a potato
from leaping with a shower of gravy on to the spotless
cloth.  With the Chinese aversion to uncooked greens, she
rejected the salad, after one nibble; it made her ill to see
the yellow oil which the others poured over their lettuce.
But the crowning disaster came with the ice cream which
the girl, unsuspecting its coldness, put into her mouth and
then had no way to extract.  The ice cream got behind her
teeth, giving her for a moment almost unendurable agony.
She lost the distinction between hot and cold, frightened
by the thought that her mouth was burning.  Almost on the
verge of fainting, she could not hide her distress.
</p>

<p>
The impish Patricia giggled and an awkward titter of
amusement went round the table as Nancy, having at last
succeeded in swallowing the nauseous stuff, choked like a
swimmer who has filled his mouth with salt water.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't fair," said Nasmith in a comforting voice;
"you ought to have your revenge and see us eating Chinese
food."
</p>

<p>
"Do you always eat Chinese food?" inquired Patricia
incredulously.  "Don't you ever get tired of it?"
</p>

<p>
"What a question from Pat, of all people," said Elizabeth,
"Pat, who's never been known to get tired of eating
any food."
</p>

<p>
Patricia gulped at the bait indignantly, but the situation
was saved for Nancy.  In the good-tempered wrangling
which ensued she could lay down her spoon unobserved and
wait calmly for the meal to end.  She soon found herself
enjoying the retorts bandied back and forth by the Ferris
children.  The wordy battle reminded her of the
three-cornered warfare between Li-an, Edward, and herself.
She began to feel immensely at home and rose from the
table quite in a mood to learn the games her new friends
wished to teach her.  She enjoyed draughts and dominoes
and smiled at Beresford's droll stories.  Nothing, however,
quite surpassed the effect of the gramophone, which she
listened to as she swung with Elizabeth and Helen in a
capacious hammock under the trees.  She had heard of
these marvelous instruments but Herrick, who hated them,
would not permit one within the walls of his home.  Amid
their host of new impressions the girl and her brother
equally could spare wonder for these black discs which
sang with such unbelievably human tones.  They pictured
enviously the sensation they could make by introducing
this miraculous toy into the gossiping perfunctory life of
the courtyards at home.
</p>

<p>
So full was the evening, so engaged were Nancy and
Edward by their new friends, that Mrs. Ferris had not the
heart to call "Bedtime" till every record had been heard;
she even let Elizabeth and Helen perform their respective
show-pieces on the piano and combine forces for a militant
duet, and at last suggested sleep only when Patricia and
David's rendering of "Turkey in the Straw" promised to
continue interminably and without variation through the
night.
</p>

<p>
She had dug up pyjamas for Edward and a nightgown
for Nancy, and now put the boy in charge of David while
the twins carried off Nancy like a prize to their own room,
offering one bed to their guest and preparing to share the
other.
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked with speechless amazement round the
clean white room.  Its daintiness, its comfort, were beyond
her experience.  She gazed at the spotless beds and at the
long mirror of the dressing table, and at the bottles,
hairbrushes, combs, and hairpin trays arrayed before it.  Helen
and Elizabeth were delighted by her surprise, overjoyed
to explain the uses of every toilet implement.  In their turn
they wished to be satisfied about every detail of Nancy's
clothes, so the three were soon busy comparing the odd
features of Western and Chinese garments.
</p>

<p>
Dressing, Nancy decided, must be an elaborate process
in the West.  She watched Helen and Elizabeth disrobe
with the attention she would have given to a play&mdash;with
more attention, indeed, for she was privileged to test the
fabrics with her sensitive fingers, rubbing her hands up
and down their white silk stockings, examining the
embroidery which it seemed so strange to her they should
conceal on their underwear, looking minutely at the lace straps
over their shoulders, the pink ribbons which held up their
chemises, the elastic girdles from which their garters were
hung.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was bewildered by such a complexity of garb.
She was ashamed to be dressed so simply, to have nothing
startling to disclose, just jacket and trousers, singlet
and drawers, and then the diamond-shaped piece of cloth
fastened by strings across the front of her body as a
guard against cholera.  There were no ribbons, no lace, no
embroidery, not even the gay sash she wore in the privacy
of the garden at home when she could rid herself of her
outer garments, nothing but severely cut, practical things
of plain cotton cloth, with just one touch of color in the
orange garters, the dividing line between her sober black
stockings and the white skin above.  Yet the two girls
envied her and sighed to exchange their frills for the
convenience of her Chinese clothing.
</p>

<p>
"We are not dressed up like this usually," explained
Helen, "only for dinner.  We wear gingham in the day-time,
but we still have the skirts to pull down and the
stockings eternally to pull up, and we never could get
ready in twice the time it takes you."
</p>

<p>
The upshot of these whispered comparisons was, of
course, a desire to exchange clothes and to pose before the
mirror in the borrowed delights of exotic garb.  Nancy
accepted the plan joyfully and watched each stage of her
masquerade, while Elizabeth and Helen nimbly tied her
in till she was a replica of themselves.  She gazed at
herself in surprise when the process was done, when her hair
had been unbound and loosely gathered into the circle of a
satin bow, for she had stepped completely over from the
East to the West and thrown away every vestige of her
Chinese upbringing.  She had the indefinable marks of
beauty, her way of holding her head and shoulders, the
slim easiness of limbs and body, the youthful melancholy
expressed by the dark color of her eyes, marks which
promised great loveliness for the future.  Helen and
Elizabeth candidly recognized the authority with which the
filmy frock and long white stockings became the
black-haired girl on whom they had been put.
</p>

<p>
"You are a beauty, Nancy!" exclaimed Elizabeth.  "The
dress seems to belong to you more than it does to me."
</p>

<p>
She suggested quite truly the difference between her
own prettiness of feature, her own healthy robustness of
figure, attractive because they were the qualities so well
suited to a romp of sixteen summers, yet qualities on which
the frock had been imposed with the obviously
self-conscious elegance of a party dress, and the charming
seriousness of Nancy's manner, to which all garments,
mean and splendid alike, paid their toll.
</p>

<p>
There was a symbolism in Nancy's appearance, a secret
betrayed by her sad smile, and spectators more imaginative
than Helen or Elizabeth might have pictured the spirit
of her mother close at hand, longing with sombre eyes to
see her daughter restored to the country she had lost.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
Edward and David were having their own good time
together.  They were not troubling much about distinctions
in clothes, once Edward had solved the mystery of how to
wear pyjamas, but they were trying to compress every
incident of the twelve and thirteen years of their lives into
the few hours given them to talk.  David, like his older
sisters, had come to China too late to pick up Chinese from
a nurse and had been sent to a school where conversation in
Chinese was discouraged, for fear of the undesirable things
the pupils might learn, so China, except in a superficial
way, was undiscovered territory.  He could not keep out of
his speech the arrogance which foreign children assumed
toward native life.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you live all the time with nothing
but Chinese?" he asked.  "Don't you ever have anybody to
play with?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, I have lots of people to play with; our
family is bigger than yours."
</p>

<p>
"But only Chinese.  That can't be much fun.  What do
you do?  How do you pass the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we're always busy.  We make poems and draw
pictures."
</p>

<p>
"For play?" David interrupted incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's lots of fun."
</p>

<p>
David could not hide his contempt.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any fun there.  The boys would laugh at
me if I wrote poems.  They'd call me a 'softy.'  We leave
things like that to the girls.  Don't you play any games,
any real games, I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we play chess&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Chess, you play chess?"
</p>

<p>
"Nancy and I are always playing it."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, that's an old man's game.  It takes a year to
make a move.  Do you play cricket?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I play cricket," said Edward, relying too
confidently on the limited instruction from his father.
</p>

<p>
At last they had come to a subject David could
appreciate.  He pounced on Edward for details as to the
positions he played, whether he bowled and how he bowled,
what was his average as a batsman, who were his team,
questions Edward answered so vaguely as to appear, in
David's eyes, as anything but skillful fraud.  Still he must
make allowances for Edward's lamentable training.
</p>

<p>
"Your idea of cricket isn't what we call cricket," he
said magnanimously, and he bewildered his guest to some
lengths by his highly technical exposition of the game.
"Where do you go to school?" he asked, after this tedious
diversion.
</p>

<p>
"We have school at home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;what form are you in?"
</p>

<p>
Edward did not know what he meant.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you got to in arithmetic?" explained
David, trying to gauge Edward's progress by his own.
"Can you do compound interest?  I can, and we've finished
South America in geography,&mdash;take up Africa next
term,&mdash;and in Latin we're on the fifth declension.  You've
begun Latin, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
Edward had to confess that these were beyond his range.
</p>

<p>
"All my work's in Chinese except the English lessons
father gives us.  We have read the Four Books&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The Four Books?" exclaimed David, seizing the first
tangible clue to Edward's education.  "What are the Four
Books?  Are they readers?"
</p>

<p>
Edward was speechless.  He could not cope with a mind
which had never heard of the Four Books.  Yet he could
not make capital of his own superior knowledge, as David
had been doing, because there was a haughtiness in the
latter's manner which made him feel that acquaintance
with the Four Books was a thing to be ashamed of.
</p>

<p>
In the same overbearing way David explored every nook
of Edward's life.
</p>

<p>
"Your father is English, isn't he?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"He was English," admitted Edward, too subdued by
now to resent the question.
</p>

<p>
"But why does he live like a Chinese?  Why doesn't he
live like an Englishman?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," answered Edward, never really conscious
before to-night that his mode of living was abnormal.
"I suppose he likes it better."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said David.  "It's so that he can have all those
wives.  In England that wouldn't be allowed."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't it?  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he would have to go to prison if he did that.  We
can only have one wife."
</p>

<p>
"But don't the rich people have several wives?"
</p>

<p>
"No, everybody's just the same.  And one wife's enough
anyway."
</p>

<p>
Edward mused on a society so curious that rich and poor
should be just the same.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to have lots of wives," he said, with
his first show of defiance, "and I'm going to have fifty
children."
</p>

<p>
David's jaw dropped.  He felt it useless to argue against
an ambition so monstrous.
</p>

<p>
"Mother will give us the dickens if we don't go to
sleep," he said, and blew out the lamp.
</p>

<p>
The family rose early.  The slight estrangement between
the two boys had been composed by Edward's tales of the
Tatar hunting park; in the congenial topic of leopards the
boys found mutual interest and Edward restored himself
in David's eyes by describing his bow and his feats of
archery.
</p>

<p>
From the first daylight the girls had resumed talking.
They put their questions more discreetly, being of a better
age to appreciate Nancy's history.  But they were more
curious than their brother about the domestic intricacies
of Timothy Herrick's life and on the glamorous subject of
concubines relished every detail they could extract from
Nancy's willing lips.  The guest was amused at the
importance they attached to such commonplace matters.
</p>

<p>
"But what will you do?" came at last the inevitable
question.  "Surely you won't marry a Chinese."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Nancy; "my father hasn't decided.
I'm not engaged yet."
</p>

<p>
"Your father!" the two girls shouted in concert; "are
you going to let your father decide?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, certainly," replied Nancy, looking at them in
surprise, "who else should decide?"
</p>

<p>
"But suppose he wants you to marry a Chinese?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy saw nothing extraordinary in this.
</p>

<p>
"I have to marry the man my father chooses."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think it's shameful," protested Elizabeth.  "You
are too pretty, Nancy, to be thrown away like that.  You
ought to choose your own husband.  Suppose he should
have some more wives; would you like that?"
</p>

<p>
"No," Nancy admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Could you stop him from having more wives?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to marry a Chinese?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nancy for the third time, "I don't want to
marry anyone.  I want to be a nun."
</p>

<p>
This was a greater blow than anything she had said.
</p>

<p>
"A nun?" echoed Elizabeth in dismay, "a Catholic nun?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy did not know what she meant by a Catholic nun.
Surely there was only one kind of nun.
</p>

<p>
"I want to be a nun and live in a temple far away in the
mountains," she said.
</p>

<p>
"You mean a Buddhist nun?  You want to live in a
temple and worship those ugly idols?"
</p>

<p>
David had not been more astounded by Edward's wish
to have fifty children, while Nancy realized, seeing the
amazed faces of her friends, that here lurked between
West and East some quicksands of misunderstanding such
as with the best will in the world they could not cross.
Her desire to be a nun was too slightly defined to be
defended in competent speech.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Elizabeth recognized her difficulty.  They were
fearful of trespassing on courtesy and did not push their
indignation more outspokenly&mdash;it was safer to turn for
diversion to the mechanical incidents of getting dressed,
Nancy's tub-bath, her initiation into the use of a sponge,
the manicuring of her nails&mdash;but the girl had become in
their eyes a tragic heroine whom they were impulsively
determined to save.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferris shared the concern of her daughters and
looked compassionately at the two children, whom she felt
she had no right to send back to such a travesty of a home.
She confided her indignation to Nasmith, thought something
ought to be done: it was shameful condemning such a
nice, well-behaved boy, such a pretty, really beautiful girl,
to live with that immoral old man.  He must have kidnapped
them; they surely could not be his children&mdash;and their
mother dead too!  How she would have suffered if she had
known!  Wasn't there a law to prevent such a disgrace?
Ronald ought to inquire of the British legation and get
Edward and Nancy into safe hands before they were
utterly ruined.
</p>

<p>
But the early breakfast had been finished.  There was no
excuse for delay.  The sorrow of parting was eased by the
decision of the twins that they must escort Nancy home
and David's prompt statement that he would do the same
duty by Edward.  The impressionable Patricia was convinced
only with difficulty that the road was too long; she
wept as though she were parting from lifelong friends.  To
the inexpressible astonishment of Edward and Nancy,
Mrs. Ferris gathered each of them into her motherly arms
and kissed them.  Would they all expect to do this, Nancy
asked herself?  Why did nice people have such barbarous
customs?  She might kiss Helen and Elizabeth, if she saw
they were disappointed, but she never could kiss
Mr. Beresford and Mr. Nasmith.  The prospect called up bitter
memories and turned her thoughts in fear to contemplating
the anger which her father would visit upon their
truancy.
</p>

<p>
The walk, begun with the care-free abandon of a picnic,
grew more and more depressing, despite the merry
companionship of the girls, Beresford's comic remarks, and
Nasmith's quiet understanding reserve, in which Nancy
put more trust than she knew.  Nancy endeavored to give
in a light-hearted vein the promises the twins were trying
to exact, that she should come and see them again, that they
might call upon her, that they should do long walks
together and write many letters.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed Nancy, "if my father will let me."
</p>

<p>
She put so much inflection upon this conditional clause
that the girls knew by instinct she was withholding more
than she offered.
</p>

<p>
"You mean he might not let you?" exclaimed Helen
tragically.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," Nancy confessed.  "I don't know.  He does
not like us to go out."
</p>

<p>
"We're going to see you anyway, no matter what he
says," was Elizabeth's indignant rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
Nancy smiled.  She hoped they might, but she dared not
encourage them.  She would not let them even climb the
final path to her home.
</p>

<p>
"My father doesn't see many people," she explained.
"He might not like it; and if he got angry he would take
us back to Peking."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith saw her point and insisted that his nieces and
nephew wait while he and Beresford accompanied their
guests to the house.  Nancy wanted to leave all of them
there, but the two men evinced a complete determination
not to forsake the children one step short of their home
door so she did not waste time in futile dissuasion.  She did
not escape from the twins, however, without embraces and
kisses, a strange affectionate demonstration she schooled
herself to endure, but she was glad to notice that Elizabeth
and Helen made no such advances toward Edward.  Plainly
there were limits to the custom.
</p>

<p>
Long before the returning prodigals had reached the
door, they were seen.  The nurse came hobbling out to meet
them and overwhelmed her foster children with tears and
affectionate exclamations, making them appreciate guiltily
the panic their absence had produced.
</p>

<p>
"Your father," cried the amah, "ai ya, he was like a
madman!  Every one of us he had out searching, even me
with my poor feet; and he would not rest; he sent us out
again and again and he himself walked tens of li before
your messenger came and eased our hearts.  Eh, we were
glad!  But that was late at night.  I cannot tell you how we
suffered before that man came.  Your father wanted to
give him five dollars.  But that was not wise; it was too
much.  I paid him a thousand cash and he was very happy."
</p>

<p>
The amah scarcely noticed Nasmith and Beresford at
first, so torrential was the greeting poured upon her two
children.  But when the party had reached the door and
were under the smiling eyes of the servants, she grew
calmer.  A flutter of old remembered occasions restored her
dignity at the welcome sight of these foreigners.  Perhaps
here was a husband for Nancy.  The foreign gentlemen
must come in and have tea and cakes; those were the Great
Man's orders.
</p>

<p>
They were not the Great Man's orders, but the amah
knew what was necessary to the moment and she was
determined the Western gentlemen who had brought back
her treasures should not depart with poor memories of the
Herrick hospitality.  So she seated them formally in the
guestroom, hurried Nancy and Edward to their rooms
where Kuei-lien was waiting excitedly to question them;
and then informed the father of his guests.  To her
intense relief the Great Man sent a message inviting the two
visitors to his own room.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith and Beresford scarcely could veil their curiosity
at sight of the elderly gentleman, wearing Chinese
clothes with dignity, who received them in his sunny room
above the ravine.  Herrick's gravity of bearing showed him
at his best in this first interview after so many years with
men of his own race.  One forgot the sensual chapters of
his story and remembered only the scholar, the background
of shelves and books seemed so fitting, and the writing
materials on his desk, the ink-stone, the brushes, the open
volume, the sheaf of bamboo papers, even accessories like
the pot of tea and the water pipe belonged to a man who
was actively concentrated upon study.
</p>

<p>
"You will excuse any defects of hospitality," Herrick
began, not choosing to remember that he had met these
men before.  "I have been a long time a stranger to your
ways.  I understand that you have saved my children from
a great danger.  It was very good of you.  I should not
have liked harm to come to these two children of mine&mdash;they
are nice children," he added, as though speaking to
himself.  "And I must thank you a great deal for walking
so far this morning to bring them safely home and your
sister for giving them a place to stay.  It was very good,
very good."
</p>

<p>
Despite his composure, Herrick was showing signs of
embarrassment.  He seemed to be commenting rather sadly
upon his own words, repeating his thoughts in a stumbling
manner which grew pathetic and stirred the sympathy of
the two men who were listening.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith hurried to relieve the old man&mdash;he was
looking much older than his years&mdash;by disclaiming credit
for anything but a fortunate and timely arrival.  He
extolled the presence of mind Nancy and Edward had
shown.  As to their staying overnight with his sister, that
was too great a pleasure to be thanked for.
</p>

<p>
"Were they a trouble?" asked the father.  "Did they
behave well?"
</p>

<p>
"They were what they clearly have been taught to be&mdash;a
lady and a gentleman.  I should be proud if my nieces
and nephew could conduct themselves in a Chinese home
as your children conducted themselves in ours."
</p>

<p>
The father smiled with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"They are nice children," he insisted.
</p>

<p>
Then another thought occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"You have nieces and nephews?" he asked.  "Did Nancy
and Edward meet them?"
</p>

<p>
Nasmith related at length his observations upon the
friendship struck up between his family and their two
guests; he saw how wistfully the father relished even the
lesser details, nodding here and there at incidents which
pleased him, repeatedly jerking out the word, "Good."  He
wanted to know the names of these nephews and nieces,
their ages, their schooling.  When he heard that they were
waiting in the path below, he would not hear of their going
home unwelcomed.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "they must not.  It is near noon.  They will
be hungry.  I will send for them&mdash;I will send Nancy herself."
</p>

<p>
The daughter came in some surprise at being summoned
before the two men had gone.  She remained standing at
the door, not presuming of course to scan the face of her
father, though she wondered if she were to be scolded
before strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," said Herrick in English, "you have left three
of our guests waiting outside.  That is not right.  We do
not pay our debts in this fashion.  You will go down and
welcome your friends and bring them to your rooms.  And
tell amah, as you go, that the cook must prepare nine
bowls."
</p>

<p>
The man meditated with amusement upon the shock his
command had given.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "she is glad.  Her eyes showed it.  Ah,
my friends, it had to come, it had to come.  I could not
keep them from making friends with their own people.  I
am not sorry it happened this way."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, after she had left the room, could scarcely believe
that she had heard aright.  To have her escapade condoned
in this manner exceeded her wildest hopes.  She was
still dazed as she repeated her father's instructions to the
amah.
</p>

<p>
"Hai, I knew it, I knew it," cried the old woman joyfully.
"He is changing at last.  The sight of men of his own
race has made him homesick.  Soon we shall all go to
England, and every afternoon you will wear new dresses
and go to garden parties."
</p>

<p>
Prophecy, on the amah's part, could be as endless as
reminiscence.  Nancy escaped on the second part of her
errand and brought her friends, who were waiting restively,
up the steep path to the house.  It was her turn to
play hostess, and she played the part with unmeasured
happiness, not even regretting the lack of gramophone and
piano, when she saw how instantly Helen and Elizabeth
were absorbed in every curious detail of the house.
Particularly were they entranced by Kuei-lien, who
welcomed them at her radiant best.
</p>

<p>
"Is she really a concubine?" asked Elizabeth in awe.
"She is such a dear, and prettier than a picture," a
compliment well earned by Kuei-lien's unerring skill in the
colors she chose to combine, jacket and trousers of a slatish
tan piped with magenta brocade.
</p>

<p>
Back and forth between them Nancy translated flattering
remarks.  The servants stood gaping.  The old nurse ran
hither and thither, like a bemuddled hen, cackling
interminable yet disjointed recollections to any and all who
even seemed to listen.  The nine bowls were got at last on
to the table, despite the confusion which prevailed, and
Nancy was made amends for her awkwardness with knife
and fork by the merrily clumsy way her guests wielded
chopsticks.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you arranged this deliberately to have your
revenge," said Helen, surveying the havoc they had
wreaked on pork balls and bean curd.
</p>

<p>
Herrick himself came to view this unprecedented party.
Nancy, Edward, Kuei-lien, all rose at his entry.  The others
followed, while the elderly man insisted upon shaking
hands with his three visitors.
</p>

<p>
"Eat, my children," he said; "don't stand any more.  It
does an old man good to see so many young faces."
</p>

<p>
"Why do they have to grow up?" he kept repeating,
when he had gone back to Nasmith and Beresford.  "Why
do they have to grow up?  Children are the only good
thing in this world.  Excuse my curiosity.  I have learned
Chinese ways, you know&mdash;you are not married, are you?"
</p>

<p>
They were not.
</p>

<p>
"Of course; I forgot.  You Englishmen don't marry so
young.  I suppose you are not thirty?  Only twenty-four?
Each of you.  Ah, that's a promising age&mdash;and a difficult
age, too.  Well, we'd all of us risk the difficulties, would
we not?"
</p>

<p>
His inquiries went further.  He extracted their names,
told them his own, apologized for having none but Chinese
cards to offer in return for their own.  So they were
teaching in a Government technical school; did they like it?
With insinuating persistence he found out their opinions
of China.  He read them a little homily on the classics,
translated lyrics from the glorious T'ang poetry, grew
genial and discursive, giving rein to his love of the
mountains and trees and falling streams and unfading children,
always children,&mdash;ah, why could they not take the
immortality of the sun they played in?&mdash;and he ended
before their wondering eyes by writing them each a pair of
scrolls in large symmetrical characters, the characters to
which he had given thirty years of his life.  He translated
them:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The sun moving to the west kindles a splendid beacon for the moon;<br>
  The moon following from the east tenderly displays the reflection<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sun."<br>
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>
"That has an interpretation," he said, smiling, as he.
handed a pair to Nasmith, "but I won't read the legend for
you.  You must learn to read it for yourself.  And this too
has its interpretation," he said, before translating
Beresford's scroll:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Mirth becomes the time of danger;<br>
  Sadness suits the time of love."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now," he said, "I have puzzled you like the old Delphic
oracle,&mdash;wasn't it?&mdash;but I have written only what
I see with my own eyes.  If my interpretations do not come
true, it will be for one reason: it will be because I am
unable to control what shall be written on my own scrolls."
</p>

<p>
"An extraordinary man," Beresford commented, after
good-byes had been said.
</p>

<p>
"And a most unhappy one," added his friend.  "I don't
think he will invite us again."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
For a long time Herrick sat in quiet, like a figure in
meditation.  The drowsiness of the afternoon seemed to have
pervaded his spirit, the strange stillness now reigning over
the house after all the laughter that had gone before.  Three
or four times the man took up his brushes, tapered the
hairs to a slender point, then replaced the brass caps and
put back the pens idly into their stand.  At last he called
for Nancy, made her sit down, and asked her to tell the
whole story of yesterday's adventure.  The perfidy of the
monks angered him.
</p>

<p>
"I shall raze their temple to its foundations," he
exclaimed, "and drive them forth homeless like the wolves
they are!"  But one knew, in listening to him, these words
would never be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
He was particular that Nancy should be explicit about
all she had done, all she had said, at the home of the
Ferrises.
</p>

<p>
"So they dressed you in foreign clothes," he remarked.
"I should like to have seen you; I should like to have
known whether my girl is really Chinese.  Did you like it?
Would you rather wear Western clothes than your own?
Shall I have them made for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," protested the girl, "they were not comfortable.
I like my own clothes better."
</p>

<p>
"And the food&mdash;the taste was not pleasant, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't eat it."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally.  Yet those are small matters."
</p>

<p>
Nancy paused at last in her tale.
</p>

<p>
"Have you told me everything?" her father asked
searchingly.  Nancy could not meet the careful scrutiny of
his eyes.  "Perhaps not quite all," he suggested.  "Western
girls have romantic thoughts in their heads.  Surely they
must have asked some questions about marriage."
</p>

<p>
"They did," admitted his daughter.
</p>

<p>
Herrick insisted on every detail of a conversation so
vital.  Nancy was confused, but she told him everything.
</p>

<p>
"Our ways do seem shocking to them," he observed.
"What did you think of Mrs. Ferris?"
</p>

<p>
The girl was glowing in the terms she used.
</p>

<p>
"And the two girls&mdash;what were their names, Helen,
Elizabeth?&mdash;did you find them really congenial?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was even more positive.
</p>

<p>
"You might not like them so well if you saw more of
them," argued her father.  "Suppose you were asked to
live with them for a month, would you enjoy that?"
</p>

<p>
The proposal was too momentous to be answered offhand.
</p>

<p>
"Would Edward go too?" asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't put too much weight on my words.  I am
only stating an imaginary case."
</p>

<p>
"I should be lonely without Edward."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, you wouldn't miss Edward; you would have lots
of companionship.  There are the two men, Mr. Beresford
and Mr. Nasmith, they would be like older brothers to
you."
</p>

<p>
"How could I have anything to do with them?" said
Nancy, surprised by the seeming indelicacy of her father's
statement.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are an innocent child, Nancy, you don't know
much about the world.  In the West the men and women
all live together like that.  They don't consider it improper.
Perhaps it's a better way than ours.  I should like you to see
for yourself; your experience has been very, very limited,
my child.  Were you afraid of these men?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy did not notice how subtly her father had shifted
from innocuous generalities to a very particular question.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, I was not afraid of them.  They were very kind
and helped us so much."
</p>

<p>
Herrick smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he resumed, "they did impress me as quite kind
and gentle in their manners, especially Mr. Beresford; he
seemed a very clever young man and talked in a most
entertaining manner.  I am not so sure about the other, what
was his name&mdash;Mr.&mdash;er, Mr.&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nasmith," volunteered Nancy rather overpromptly.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Nasmith, Mr. Nasmith.  Mr. Nasmith, I
thought, was a little stupid; he didn't say much."
</p>

<p>
Nancy took the bait instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, he's not stupid," she averred, "not at all stupid.
He is really kinder, more thoughtful, than Mr. Beresford."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Herrick, after a pause, "and since when have
daughters known more than their fathers?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was properly confounded.  Her cheeks grew red
with embarrassment, but Herrick's sternness consisted in
words alone.  He had got the hint he wished and could
afford to smile at his own reproof, for the wisdom of a
father sometimes compassed facts his daughter had not
even guessed, facts she lacked the experience to
acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
Nancy went away much puzzled.  She had thought, from
some of her father's questions, that he actually intended
sending her to visit the Ferrises.  In the first lonely
reaction to the excitement she had been enjoying, excitement
so unexampled in her tranquil life, she wished with all her
heart he would let her go so that she might laugh and talk
and share her world of new impressions with Elizabeth and
Helen.  The house still echoed to their voices, the rooms
were still haunted by their eager merry faces.  Edward was
no comfort to her just now.  Life had suddenly become
drab.
</p>

<p>
She went to her room, bolted the door, lay face down on
the bed and abandoned her overladen heart to a spell of
frantic weeping.
</p>

<p>
Herrick too had done a thing he seldom did: he had gone
walking alone.  He also felt the depression which pervaded
the house.  He had got a glimpse of Edward, sitting woebegone
in the courtyard, trying, with the half-hearted need
of doing something, to fashion a new bow.  The sight was
too much.  Here was another problem forced upon him.  He
had been thinking so exclusively of Nancy, whose case
was so urgent, that he had forgotten poor Edward for the
moment, forgotten that his was another difficult future to
provide.  The man could not sit at home any longer.  He had
to walk off his mood by stubborn climbing, climbing which
did not end till he had scaled the old beacon tower and
seated himself heavily in a bastion that overlooked leagues
of mountain.
</p>

<p>
Here he had no choice but to think.  He saw only vaguely
the lucent glory of the scene, the still evening sunshine,
the imperturbable towers of the distance; even the far,
far-away golden palace roofs of Peking vexed him because
they spoke of the peace he had been seeking these many
years whereas his mind had been betrayed into nothing but
ugly turmoil.
</p>

<p>
Herrick pictured the might-have-beens of the past.  Suppose
he had sent his children home, as he knew he ought to
have done when he first discarded his kinship with the
West; what would they have been now?  Would the benevolence
of uncles and aunts have compensated for the loss
of their father?  Yes, perhaps it might have compensated
them; they would have grown up ignorant of the parent
whom their elders would refer to in bated, pitying
terms as a man gone wrong.  It might have compensated
them; but how could it have made up to him for the loss
of his two children?
</p>

<p>
He wished he could have seen Nancy in a Western frock
as the Ferris girls had clothed her.  Then he might have
judged for himself whether she was to be preferred to the
grave maiden whom the East had trained.  By now she
would have spent twelve years in the peace of an English
garden.  She would be making the daily round of her
flowers, the primroses and foxgloves and hollyhocks he
could fancy her tending, and playing tennis on the cropped
lawn, or reading lazily in a basket chair, dreaming of the
seaside and dances and picnics.  And Edward would be
home for the holidays, speaking the amazing idiom of a
schoolboy.  It was a pleasant picture, Herrick admitted,
rather sentimental perhaps, and, except when he was homesick,
a little insipid; but the one element of the scene which
stuck in his mind was that in this scene he could take no
part.  He certainly did not wish to be doddering round with
a cane or listening to his relatives as they discussed the
vicar's Whitsunday sermon and the prospects of the county
show or the perennially banal topic of Farmer George's
rheumatism.  It seemed really a merit not to have
condemned Nancy and Edward to this.
</p>

<p>
No, it was not the past of which Herrick was jealous,
but the future, the future which threatened to tear away
his children.  The father discerned the enmity of fate in the
chance that, after his long-maintained watchfulness,
suddenly had given Nancy and Edward friends from the
West.  He hated these friends, hated the attraction which
would undo all his careful work, breathing life into the
stolid wood-block people of their English readers, restoring
to the girl and the boy a living tongue for one he wished
them to think of as dead.  He was jealous of Helen and
Elizabeth, jealous of Mrs. Ferris and Beresford, but above
all things jealous of the quiet Nasmith, in whose destiny
he perceived some occult link with Nancy's itself.
</p>

<p>
"I will not give them up," he said vehemently.  "After
training them all these years, after giving them something
better and finer than anything they could have got in
England, what a fool I should be to turn them over to the first
blond strangers they meet.  It would be a waste, nothing
more than a waste.  Nasmith and the rest of them can
hang before I'll let Nancy or Edward see them again.  I
won't destroy my own work."
</p>

<p>
Having made this decision, which decided nothing, Herrick
gave it immediate effect.  He ordered his children for
their safety's sake not to go out of the temple enclosure.
He said nothing more about Nancy's visiting the Ferrises.
He was mastered by the need to forget all these urgent
problems.  He called for wine, called for his opium pipe,
called for Kuei-lien.
</p>

<p>
She went to him with a happy smile on her face for she
had been waiting a long, long time to hear this summons.
With the instinctive genius of the wanton she lured the
man to new frenzies of love, taunted him, by a modesty
artfully affected, into committing new blissful indignities,
glamorous outrages, in which her master tried to stifle
the soul as well as the body of his slave and succeeded only
in stifling his own.  Then she sat naked on the floor before
his couch, her hair raveled but her eyes cool, and lighted
the lamp and heated the first of the little pellets which were
to induce days of passionate stupor.  He dozed; he
dreamed; the sickly smoke filled the room.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien picked up her scattered garments.  She was still
smiling.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
For a full week Herrick lived behind closed doors.  It was
a long devastating bout, and it was a hatefully dull week
for Nancy and Edward.  Recent liberty made their present
confinement wear all the more heavily.  Romantic memories
of Elizabeth and Helen and David made the lonely children
captious and cross with one another.  They had no
zest for books; the sun kept eternally shining; it called
them away to the mountain tops.  Edward fumed because
he could get no practice with his newly made bow; Nancy
sat on the platform above the ravine, musing as to who
should rescue her from her boredom, and more and more
she wondered who could rescue her from fear.  For fear
was beating at the gates of her courage.
</p>

<p>
In this narrow temple of the Western Hills Herrick's
absence weighed like sultry heat upon the atmosphere of
the household, quieting the tongue of the amah and the
vociferous exchanges of the servants.  Kuei-lien came and
went with the preoccupation of a nurse waiting upon a sick
man.  But the fact Nancy saw and the fact she despised
was that the preoccupation was a happy one.  At last, one
day Nancy could stand it no more.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see my father," she said.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien looked at her with surprise.  The sneer on her
lips almost faded before the resolute dignity of the girl.
For the first time the all-conquering audacity of the
concubine was checked; Kuei-lien began to feel misgivings
about this stubborn child, misgivings and a little fear,
because she could not meet Nancy's obstinacy with her usual
effective mockery.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see my father," the girl repeated.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't see him," Kuei-lien said.  "He is busy.
He would call for you if he wished to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Ask him if I may see him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can ask him, but I know what his answer will be."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien went away much disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"I have had the most absurd request from Nancy," she
told her master, who was lying heavily on his couch.  "She
wants to see you.  She told me she must see you."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, tell her to come," said Herrick.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien could not believe the report of her own ears.
</p>

<p>
"You want her to come?" she asked.  "I told her you
were too busy to see her."
</p>

<p>
"What right have you to speak for your master?" the
man shouted.  "Go and tell her to come."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien had no course but to go.
</p>

<p>
"You have made a pretty mess of things," she warned
Nancy.  "Your father is furiously angry at your asking to
see him.  He said, Yes, you should see him, and ordered me
to make you come."
</p>

<p>
"I am going without being forced," said Nancy with
irritating self-possession.  "You don't have to make me."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien, balked in her effort to frighten the girl, went
ahead of her and opened the door of Herrick's bedroom.
The shutters had been thrown wide to let in the late
afternoon sun, but there had not been time to clear the
mustiness of the place, the lurking odor of the drug, which
clung to the bed curtains and to the implements laid ready
on a table by Herrick's side.
</p>

<p>
Nancy evinced not a sign of disgust as she entered
the room and stood waiting impassively for her father's
first words.  Yet she seemed out of place amid the disorder
of the chamber, which was littered with signs of
Kuei-lien's occupancy.
</p>

<p>
This was apparent to Herrick himself.  Although the
situation could not foster any illusion as to how he had been
spending his days, the father nevertheless made the effort
to greet his daughter with the ceremony proper between
them.  His orgy had burned itself out, but his face showed
the strain of dissipation; his eyes were dull, there were
haggard lines round the mouth, pouches of puffy flesh
beneath his eyes.  Nancy could not avoid glimpses of his
unkempt fingers nor of the loose robe bound round his
body.
</p>

<p>
"And what is it so important that you must ask permission
to see me?" Herrick inquired, speaking in Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had her one sentence prepared.  She uttered it in
a low cool voice.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid to leave my father so long alone with his
enemy."
</p>

<p>
A pause, fraught with deep feeling, ensued upon these
daring words.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" Herrick asked finally.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted the girl, "that is all."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, you may go."
</p>

<p>
Nancy turned obediently and went out of the room.
Even Kuei-lien had the decency to wait until the child was
out of earshot before she gave vent to her mirth.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!" she laughed.  "What a speech!  Afraid to
leave her father alone with his enemy.  Whom does she
mean?  Does she mean me?"
</p>

<p>
Her amusement was not very convincing.  It seemed
forced, bolstered up by weak bravado.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she means you," retorted her master, "she means
you and she means all this mischievous rubbish."
</p>

<p>
With a sweep of his hand he brushed the glasses, the
opium pipe, the little lamp, from the surface of the table.
They fell with a crash to the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so wasteful," protested the concubine, more
entertained by this flare of temper on Herrick's part than
by Nancy's grim sentence.  "What a shame to break all
these things.  You'll need them again."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is the beastly part of it," Herrick acknowledged,
"I shall need them again&mdash;but not now&mdash;not now.
And I don't need you either.  You may go."
</p>

<p>
"Your eloquence is not so impressive as your daughter's,"
said Kuei-lien, as she retreated.  Her indomitable
capacity for being merry never deserted the girl, even at
times of defeat.
</p>

<p>
Left to himself at last, Herrick began to repair the
disorders of the past few days.  He shaved, dressed himself
neatly, returned to his books and his pens.  But throughout
the mechanical functions which helped to bring back
self-respect, his mind was filled with the vision of Nancy's
face, her impassive demeanor, in unreproaching contact
with the signs of his own collapse.  Again and again he
mumbled the girl's words.  It was a curiously saving trait
in Herrick's character that he did not resent them.
</p>

<p>
"'Alone with his enemy,'" he kept saying, "How right
she was, how just!  Ah, but I must take care lest my enemy
be her enemy too."
</p>

<p>
Then on a sudden came a frightening spasm of pain, the
first in his life.  Always Herrick had been well and robust,
seldom ill for two days together; but now he gasped and
choked, held his hand to his chest, thinking with ungovernable
terror that he was going to die with all the loose
strings of his life untied.  After minutes that were years,
the spell passed.  He lay back white-faced in a chair, his
forehead pouring sweat.  He recognized the warning.  His
heart was affected.  What use would there be in disguising
the truth?
</p>

<p>
Herrick had no intention to consult a physician.  Physicians
had not saved his wife; they had never been of use
to him.  He knew the advice they would give: diet,
self-control, no excitement.  They had no cure for this
complaint.  Some people lived on for years, others were snuffed
out in a night; what was bound to fall fell despite the
advice of all the doctors in the world.  After the gripping
pain had relaxed&mdash;there was no room for any state except
fear while it lasted&mdash;the man even treated the subject
jauntily and swore he was as likely as any to round off his
threescore and ten.  But he could not do it peacefully if he
left any room for grief to befall Nancy and Edward.
</p>

<p>
It was after this attack that Ronald Nasmith received a
letter to which with surprise he saw Herrick's signature
attached.  The note was short, impersonal in its wording;
the writer had business of importance he could not discuss
on paper; he asked Mr. Nasmith to indulge the infirmities
of an older man by paying him a visit; he also must request
that his letter and the subject of the visit be treated as
confidential.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith dispatched Beresford as acting-uncle on a picnic
to some hot springs while he slipped away to see Herrick.
His mind during the past few days had been much
occupied with Herrick and the puzzle of the scrolls.  He
had been studying a riddle which instinct told him was full
of personal import, a message that Herrick intended and
wished him to decipher.  Yet the answer evaded his closest
research.  It might seem easy to Herrick, schooled in these
antithetical couplets by which the Chinese conveyed the
many thoughts they did not care to lay bare on the surface;
it was not clear to Nasmith, who burrowed through all his
dictionaries and went to the length of asking help from his
teacher.  The dictionaries explained little and the teacher,
although he exclaimed at once that the characters were the
work of a master, offered explanations so involved that
Nasmith, even though he understood less than half of what
his teacher said, knew that this excess of commentary was
merely the happy Chinese way of concealing ignorance: the
teacher was groping for a clue, as Nasmith once before
had caught him doing when the drowsy pedagogue had
elaborated the most profound moral sentiments from what
proved to be simply the Chinese transliteration of the name
Australia.  In the end, exhaustive study had not told as
much as Herrick himself chose to reveal:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sun moving to the west kindles a splendid beacon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the moon;<br>
  The moon following from the east tenderly displays the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflection of the sun.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I wonder if he will have expected me to master his
riddle," thought Nasmith, as he set out upon his long walk.
</p>

<p>
Herrick received his guest in the same room as before.
He was regaining the dominance of his nerves but there
was, nevertheless, a stiffness of bearing which caused
Nasmith to eye his host keenly, anxious for any hint of
the business in hand, and to note marks of the upheaval
through which the man had been passing.  Something was
wrong&mdash;business cares, worries about property, some
trouble in which the man could not turn to Chinese friends
for assistance.  Perhaps Herrick wanted an executor or a
witness to his will.  No, that could not be the difficulty; he
would have called for Beresford as well.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are mystified as to the reasons for my
letter," Herrick began.  "Did you read the scroll I wrote
for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I tried to read it," Nasmith admitted.
</p>

<p>
"And failed.  I am not surprised.  It was the truth, and
the truth is always far-fetched.  I have, I am afraid, the
Chinese faculty for talking in riddles and as to the inner
meaning of those two sentences I prefer not to explain it,
for the best part of your life will come when you find out
the meaning for yourself&mdash;if you do."
</p>

<p>
"That is putting rather too great a strain on my curiosity,
don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  But I'm going to offer you the key to the
puzzle and you can make the best of it as you choose."
</p>

<p>
Herrick fingered the lip of his teacup for a minute or
two while Nasmith wondered if he had been summoned
all this distance merely to hear more of such cryptic
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think my wits are wandering?" Herrick asked
with disconcerting suddenness.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure of it," replied his guest, willing to be as
provokingly frank.  The older man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I have been ill," he said, "but my wits are still here.
I have wit enough to recognize an honest man; that is why
I have asked you to come."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you; the compliment is enjoyed, even if it isn't
deserved."
</p>

<p>
"How much patience would you have, to keep talking in
this vein?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much more," Nasmith confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you will never become Chinese."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish to."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  You are thoroughly English, quite thoroughly
English, aren't you?  You wouldn't care to follow my
example and become Chinese?"
</p>

<p>
"If you wish me to say what I think, I should say a life
like yours was a waste, a shameful waste, not fair to
yourself, Mr. Herrick, and especially not fair to your two
children."
</p>

<p>
"You are honest, that is the important point.  For your
opinions, Mr. Nasmith, I don't care a snap of the finger.
Opinions don't have half the influence we imagine.  But
you have touched the subject I have in mind.  It is my
children and what is fair to them that I am keeping in
mind.  I have been ill: without mincing matters I might
just as well tell you I have very definite signs of heart
trouble.  You know what that means.  It means that I might
drop even while I am talking with you here.  That is
disquieting.  I don't care to leave the future of my children
dependent on the whims of this worn-out heart of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you keep them in China?  Why don't you take
them home?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a home here and I am too old to change it, don't
wish to change it, in fact.  No, I didn't call you for advice,
Mr. Nasmith; I am capable of giving myself all the advice
you can suggest.  If I wished to, I could put Nancy and
Edward to school, but I don't wish to.  Let's not argue
about it, just say I am too selfish, too pig-headed, not
willing at my time of life to lose the company of two
delightful children.  I want something more definite from you,
something which will be a real provision for the future and
not the making myself and my children miserable by
shipping them off to school among strangers and
foreigners&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You want, then&mdash;" interrupted Nasmith, anxious to
stem Herrick's garrulous speech.
</p>

<p>
"I want to betroth my daughter Nancy to you."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
Nasmith did not answer.  The proposal was too unexpected
to fit into any compartment of his mind.  Room had
first to be made for it, room provided with hesitation and
an agitated heart.  Nasmith did not deny that Nancy had
occupied much of his thought, more than he openly
allowed.  He could not shake out of his memory the sight of
the girl, poised tiptoe for flight, as she stood between the
doors of the temple.  He had been haunted by the picture,
haunted by a crying sense of wrong in restoring the girl
to a dangerous, tragic future.  But Herrick's offer was too
real.  It was stern stuff to be built upon such vague
foundations.
</p>

<p>
"Don't imagine I wanted to bring up this subject," said
Herrick.  "I don't wish to see Nancy married to you or to
anyone else.  I would hide her from every last one of you
if I had the choice.  You haven't got her, I tell you; you
haven't got her yet.  I may hide her despite you.  Ah, if I
only had the choice!  This stupid heart of mine has taken
the choice out of my hands."
</p>

<p>
"There is no need to be angry with me for weighing
your own proposal," Nasmith said.  "Your suggestion is no
less a shock to me than it seems to be to yourself.  But
before going into my side of the matter, I think we must
consider Nancy's side.  Whatever my own inclinations may
be&mdash;and I must confess they are not very definite&mdash;I
would not consider your offer for a moment if I thought
the arrangement would be distasteful to your daughter.
What do you think she would say at being disposed of in
this summary manner to a man who is practically a
stranger?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not at all so dreadful as you imagine.  Nancy's
training all her life has led her to expect no other method
of betrothal.  Your haphazard Western fashion would
seem scandalous to her.  A father is more competent to
choose a husband for his daughter than the girl herself;
he knows the world, she doesn't.  No doubt she has her
fancies, but if she is betrothed to a man who is not
utterly impossible it will not be hard to attach her fancies to
the husband chosen for her."
</p>

<p>
"That may be so; I am not prepared to deny it, though
it seems to me, in the main, a heartless business.  But what
about my share in the contract?  I have not been educated
to think your Chinese way is normal.  Can I attach my
fancies to a girl I have hardly known?"
</p>

<p>
"Is this merely a theoretical question or have you some
practical plan in mind?  I certainly feel no need to
advertise the merits of my daughter.  You have seen her and,
if you are the man I take you for, you have understood
her.  Remember this: it was not by throwing dice or tossing
a coin that I chose you instead of Beresford.  He, I think,
would have jumped at my offer&mdash;I should suspect anyone
who jumped at so unusual an offer as mine."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not putting a theoretical question; I have a
most practical plan," said Nasmith.
</p>

<p>
"I know your plan; you want Nancy to live with your
sister."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I want more than that.  I want her sent to
school with my nieces."
</p>

<p>
"You want me to undo the last twelve years of her
training."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I am quite satisfied with her training, but
if she is to be a Westerner it has to be given a more
definite direction; it cannot continue on Chinese lines.  There
will not be much shock now; there would be tremendous
shock a few years later."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was prepared for all these arguments," said
Herrick, "and for a few more as well.  By living with your
sister, Nancy would come to know you better; you in turn
would have a better acquaintance with her.  Yes, I know
all these arguments.  And suppose, after this mutual
acquaintance, you found your tastes growing farther and
farther apart, what would you do to remedy the situation?"
</p>

<p>
"Break the engagement."
</p>

<p>
"No, that's not my notion of a betrothal.  That simply
transfers Nancy from my care, puts her at the mercy of all
the accidents which may occur in your sister's home,
possible jealousies or gossip or misunderstanding,&mdash;you know
the things I mean,&mdash;and leaves her with the chance of a
broken engagement at the end.  Then what would she be
fit for?  Do you expect her to go out and capture a husband
as your Western women do or come back to the Chinese
life she has unlearned?"
</p>

<p>
"At least, it is better," protested Nasmith, "to discover
uncongenial tastes before marriage than afterward."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  After marriage you have made your bargain.
You have no choice but to make your tastes congenial.
Have you forgotten your old proverb about necessity?  It's
when people have the option of being uncongenial that they
look for excuses to quarrel just to assert their freedom.
If I sent Nancy to you in a red chair to-morrow, I haven't
the slightest doubt that she would prove congenial.  It would
be your duty to see that she did."
</p>

<p>
"You don't really wish me to marry her now?" demanded
Nasmith, somewhat disconcerted, "a girl of seventeen."
</p>

<p>
"A girl of sixteen," Herrick corrected.  "No, indeed I
don't wish you to marry her now.  I don't wish to surrender
her a day before she is twenty, that is, if my heart holds
out.  If I die, she goes to you at once and Edward with
her&mdash;he will be suitably provided for.  But while I live or
until she is twenty Nancy remains with me."
</p>

<p>
"And you expect me to consent to betrothal on these
terms?"
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it is rather one-sided?"
</p>

<p>
"It is one-sided," Herrick admitted, "but it appears more
one-sided now than it will later.  I am asking you to put
inordinate trust in the judgment of an old man who has
done some thinking about the both of you.  I have put
twelve years into what you might term an experiment.
Nancy is the result, and if you think the result lovable&mdash;as
I do&mdash;you will give some credit to the methods which
achieved it.  I want just four more years, four more years;
the Nancy you see now will not bear comparison with the
Nancy I am offering you as a bride.  Ah, if my heart had
not given out I shouldn't need to be begging you; you
would be begging me.  Nancy needs no excuses, sir, no
apologies, but I&mdash;I need four years of security, four years
of peace of mind, to complete my work and to keep the love
of my children.  It is only in your own interests that I am
asking you to make a one-sided bargain."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith was moved by Herrick's earnestness, but he
was not convinced.  Nasmith paused.
</p>

<p>
"Then you refuse my terms," he said, at last, after
allowing the effect of Herrick's passionate appeal to grow
cold, "you will not let Nancy visit my sister, nor go to
school with my nieces, not even if I bind myself to marry
your daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot accept such terms even if you bind yourself.
I have considered them, Mr. Nasmith, considered them
thoroughly, long before I sent for you.  They are too great
a price for any betrothal.  I would rather take chances with
my heart."
</p>

<p>
"Is it fair to take such chances, fair to leave a young
girl without protection?"  Nasmith was angry in his
deliberate way.  "What other alternative have you, if I
refuse?"
</p>

<p>
Herrick smiled.  He had his trump card to play.
</p>

<p>
"I have the alternative I have entertained from the
beginning&mdash;until I met you, in fact, and thought I had
found a man large-minded enough, generous enough to
make it unnecessary.  I have the alternative of marrying
Nancy to a Chinese."
</p>

<p>
"You are trying to threaten me now," said Nasmith.
"You chose the wrong man.  I will not be threatened into
betrothing myself to your daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Don't decide too hastily," said Herrick; "we'll have
tiffin first."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, but I have decided.  There is no use wasting
more time.  You have my terms; I have yours.  The situation
is simple.  Which one of us intends to change?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't," vowed Herrick.
</p>

<p>
"Neither do I."
</p>

<p>
With these words Nasmith picked up his helmet, bowed
to his astonished host, and departed.
</p>

<p>
"I've made the attempt," said Herrick to himself, much
piqued by the failure of tactics he had reckoned sure of
success.  "I have offered him the choice decently and fairly.
If he thinks I am going to seek him out and get down on
my knees, begging him to take a girl who is twice too good
for him, he can wait till the Yellow River runs dry."
</p>

<p>
Some such hope had occurred to Nasmith.  The knowledge
that Nancy had been offered to him acted like sun
and rain upon his memory of her, so that only now did he
begin to realize how strong was the hold she had gained.
Whatever the feeling might be, it disturbed him.  In a fever
of uneasiness most unusual to his orderly nature he awaited
Herrick's next overture, waited till his impatience could
be brooked no further.  There was that last ever-disquieting
threat.  Would the father be fool enough or selfish or
wrong-headed enough to carry it into effect?  Nasmith
even regretted his own judgment, his own conduct, right
though he knew these had been.  At last, unable to contain
his distress, he walked the long road to Herrick's temple
and found it vacant, with only a bleary-eyed caretaker to
tell him Herrick had taken his family, son and daughter,
concubine and nurse, back to Peking.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
The departure had been as sudden, as arbitrary, as
Herrick's few acts of decision usually were.  The household
had not recovered from the surprise of Nasmith's visit
when orders came to pack.  In the mysterious way by which
news permeates a Chinese dwelling the subject of Herrick's
conversation with his guest was common property while
the two men were still debating it.  Kuei-lien in great glee
told Nancy that her engagement was being arranged.  She
was to be married to one of the light-haired men who had
rescued her, the one with the little moustache under his
nose.  Nancy, who recognized Nasmith from Kuei-lien's
mocking description, blushed a violent red and denied that
any such transaction was in progress.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes it is," declared the concubine, "I know.  They
are discussing your presents right now.  What a way to do
it, with no middleman!  But that's your foreign custom.
Soon you'll be squeezing your waist into corsets and hiding
your face with a white veil like a mourner.  Poor Nancy,
you won't have a red chair; foreigners never use them.
They'll put you into a motor car and send you to a foreign
worship hall where you'll have to kiss your husband and
take his hand, so"&mdash;Nancy jerked free from Kuei-lien's
provoking fingers,&mdash;"and then you'll use a knife and a
fork and eat goat's meat till you smell like a Mongolian
shepherd."
</p>

<p>
"I won't, I won't, I won't!" vowed Nancy, stamping her
foot.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease her," begged the nurse, beaming with smiles
at the happy news; "you know it is not seemly to talk to
a maiden about her future husband."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's quite all right by foreign custom.  Your fiancé
will come every day to see you; we shall all hide behind the
door while you sit and talk and make love together."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is the custom," the amah admitted.  "She will
grow used to it.  She ought to follow the practice of her
ancestors."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, however, had not stayed to listen.  She had
slammed the doors of her room in their faces and flung
herself across the bed, where in the semi-darkness she
meditated upon a change she never for a moment doubted
had been agreed to.  It was while the nurse still
triumphantly declaimed the fitness of Nancy's marrying an
Englishman that Herrick appeared in the courtyard to
deliver his curt message that they were to return to Peking
on the morrow.  The exultant words were frozen on the
tongue of the amah.  She had seen in Herrick's eyes the
defeat of all her hopes.
</p>

<p>
Nancy and Edward were miserable at coming back to
Peking.  It was utterly dispiriting to be fenced by high
walls in a garden that had shrunk: no wide views, no sound
of tumbling streams, no walks across hills teeming with
wild flowers&mdash;just the beat of paddles as the clothes were
rinsed at the pond and the tedious gossip of women whose
minds were confined like their bodies.  The boy and girl
relapsed into their old routine, took up again studies with
their teacher, intermittent lessons with their father, the
usual round of writing and reading, yet all with lassitude
of spirit, with hearts aching for the hills.
</p>

<p>
Not even the Mid-autumn Festival, which because of the
fewness of the Chinese holidays always had made such a
stir in their lives, could wake the children from this
lethargy.  Nancy passed idly by the flowering cassia, the pride
of her courtyard, and wholly forgot to thrust a sprig of the
fragrant white blossoms into her hair.  More from habit
than from relish she ate her round moon cakes and climbed
into the pine to see the largest moon of the year rise
slowly from the east.  She was homesick for her brief hours
with Helen and Elizabeth and wrote them letters in English,
long, affectionate letters which she could not send
because she had no knowledge of where to send them.  The
exercise did bring some comfort; it seemed to provide
some intercourse with her friends, and would have
entertained them greatly, could the naïve, oddly phrased
missives have found their destination.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien did not visit Nancy as she used to do.  The
words the daughter had spoken about her father's enemy
were hard to forgive.  She never pressed Nancy for their
meaning because she always avoided unprofitable quarrels,
but it became her policy to be cool to the girl, to snub her
as one might snub a pert child.  Much of the time she spent
with the t'ai-t'ai, to whom she had related the tale of the
summer.  The t'ai-t'ai agreed unreservedly that Nancy and
Edward were a problem; they ought to be sent back to
the West.  She offered no proposal, however, as to how they
should be sent.  The fact was that she was nursing plans of
her own, plans which might not jump with Kuei-lien's
humor.
</p>

<p>
She had gone to her husband, shortly after his return,
and taxed him on the subject of her own daughter, Li-an.
The girl was twelve.  Ought they not to be choosing her
a husband?
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" exclaimed Herrick in English, "have we
got to find another?"
</p>

<p>
"My heart will have no peace till she is engaged," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"But Li-an is only a babe in arms."
</p>

<p>
"She is twelve," the mother repeated.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know the child.  Bring her here.  Let me talk to
her."
</p>

<p>
Herrick's attention had in truth been so predominantly
centred on Nancy and Edward that the second daughter
came before her father like a stranger.  There had never
been the contact of English lessons to quicken his
knowledge of this fast growing girl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is pretty," he thought to himself, "and, thank
heaven, Chinese."
</p>

<p>
Herrick examined the scholarship of his daughter, put
many questions which she answered cleverly.  Then the
whim seized him to ask what he had asked of Nancy, to
see how she would pass the test of bringing what she
valued most.  Li-an went at once to her mother and told her
of Herrick's strange request.
</p>

<p>
"The most precious thing you have?" inquired the t'ai-t'ai.
"What a thing to ask!  We must think about it and
make sure not to disappoint him.  You might take a copy
of Mencius, or the Four Books, or perhaps your ink-stone
and brush.  No, they won't do; I have a much better
plan."
</p>

<p>
She extracted a photograph from her box.
</p>

<p>
"Take that," she said; "that will please him."
</p>

<p>
Herrick received the photograph and looked at it curiously.
Then he frowned.  The picture was one of himself
taken years before, a portrait which revealed its subject
in the stiff pose so dear to Chinese photographers: there
were flower pots bestowed in harsh symmetry on either
side of him, a drop painted to show trees and balustrades
behind, and Herrick, glued to the chair, facing the camera
with exasperated belligerency as though daring the lens
to do its worst&mdash;which it did.  The man had forgotten
such a picture existed.  In a moment of weakness he had
given way before the entreaties of the t'ai-t'ai and
consented to its being taken.
</p>

<p>
"Who put you up to bringing this atrocity?" he demanded.
He tore the picture asunder and threw the pieces
on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Tell your mother," he said, "that it is rather early to
be teaching her daughter to lie."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai appeared, full of explanations, full of
apologies.  The child had been puzzled by her father's command,
and was unhappy because she had nothing precious enough
to take to her father.
</p>

<p>
"So I asked her whom she honored most.  'My father,'
Li-an answered, 'of course I honor my father more than
anybody.'  I showed her the photograph merely to test her
and instantly she begged me to let her have it.  When I saw
the happiness come over her face and how she valued it
I suggested that this was the gift to bring to her father.  I
am sorry it displeased you, but there was no time to frame
it suitably."
</p>

<p>
The excuse was so much more flagrant than the offense
itself that the man could not keep back a burst of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Not even from your lips can two lies cancel each other,
my good lady," he remarked dryly in English.  The t'ai-t'ai
was a standard by which he could mark his growing
absorption into Chinese life and realize how much deeper
he still needed to sink himself before the waters covered his
soul.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid your daughter is much too clever," he said,
openly accepting Li-an's ill-advised act as a joke.  "Fancy a
child of twelve practising such artful wiles on her old
father."
</p>

<p>
The mother's face beamed in relief.
</p>

<p>
"But we mustn't be in too great a hurry in choosing her
a husband.  We must make certain of a suitable man.
Meantime I want your help in something far more pressing.
You realize of course that Nancy is four years older than
Li-an.  We must make some arrangement for her; we can't
delay it any longer.  I thought for a time of marrying her
to an Englishman, but now that I have been thinking about
the matter I know that Nancy, though she is
English-born, can never be at home in the West.  She is Chinese by
nature and training and speech, and Chinese she ought to
remain; so now I am determined to find a Chinese husband
for Nancy, and I want you to be matchmaker.  Please don't
annoy me by a statement of objections and difficulties; I
know these as well as you.  But there are a few points to
keep in mind: first, I must see the man you suggest.  I am
not going to be put off with any dunderheads; I want the
best.  If I can't get the best there will be no engagement.
Furthermore, the man must be of good family; he must be
well educated, a man of scholarly tastes&mdash;and he must
know no English, no English at all.  I won't have a son-in-law
sucking his breath and grinning at his own smartness
as he gibbers 'Yes-s' and 'Alright.'  Do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
The woman nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You may think I am asking the impossible in expecting
such a paragon.  Well, you know the proverb that what we
value cheaply we sell cheaply.  We don't need to apologize
for Nancy and I will not have you setting about this task
as though we were asking favors.  Yet of course there will
be a prejudice against the girl because of her foreign birth.
That perhaps will frighten the conservative families, the
very families we ought to look to for decent, obedient,
scholarly boys.  I am ready to make one concession to
overcome the handicap of Nancy's having been born English;
if I am satisfied with the man you choose, I will give Nancy
a portion of ten thousand taels at her marriage; if I am
very well satisfied, I might stretch the sum to fifteen
thousand."
</p>

<p>
After this last offer, which outweighed all Herrick's
other provisions, the t'ai-t'ai accepted her commission as
matchmaker.  She was admirably fitted for the post, since
she came of good family herself, an excellent but
impecunious family with many ramifications, many branches, all
prolific of sons and daughters, all equally genteel, all
equally poor.  Within the confines of her own family the
t'ai-t'ai knew she could find many candidates for Nancy's
hand.  She did not propose to look further.
</p>

<p>
Her father had been Herrick's teacher of Chinese.  He
was a gentleman of the old school, a scholar of distinction,
benignant in his ways, a fountainhead of Chinese lore.  The
family had been broken by the disgrace of the patron,
whom an arbitrary whim of the Empress Dowager had
banished from court.  Without exception every man of the
family had been thrown out of official employment.  Years
of vain waiting for reinstatement had followed: they could
not dig; to beg they were ashamed.  Swiftly their fortune
melted away till Herrick's future father-in-law broke with
tradition by undertaking to instruct foreigners in the
obscurities of the Mandarin tongue.
</p>

<p>
For a long time he was the only man of his extensive
family who deigned to work.  The others continued from
day to day, living always on the edge of solvency, getting
food and clothing by some mysterious means of which
Chinese families are rarely so impoverished as to lose the
secret; they had been rather contemptuous over the one
member who stooped to teach foreign devils for a living,
but they did not scruple to share in the profits of his
abasement; they were outraged by his marrying a daughter to a
foreign devil, but always borrowed a liberal part of the
money the t'ai-t'ai brought home as her gift to the
exchequer.  They waited and taught their sons and grandsons
to wait for the turn of affairs which might restore them to
office, restore them to the emoluments of magistracies and
deputy inspectorships.  Waiting had become the family
profession and was practised with all the assiduity of the
Oriental who has known better times and feels sure that in
some lucky cycle of the future, in the wheel which shifts
dynasties and oligarchies and republics and chaos, fate
again will provide better times to her patient servants.
The t'ai-t'ai, surveying the case, decided that fifteen
thousand taels would be an extremely useful addition to
the family fortunes, the very harbinger of better times.
There was more profit to be made out of Nancy than out
of her own daughter Li-an, for Nancy, being no kin, could
be married to a member of her prolific family, whereas
Li-an's dowry would be swallowed by some other voracious
clan.  It would be foolish to let fifteen thousand taels slip
out of her hands to the advantage of someone else.  With so
many nephews and cousins sitting idle at home, one surely
could be sacrificed in the interests of the family, even to
contract something so undesirable as a mixed marriage.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai put the reins of the household into the hands
of the nurse&mdash;she was always careful not to give power
to a concubine&mdash;and after she had stipulated this and
stipulated that, lest the old amah wax rich in her absence,
she climbed into a mule cart and started lumbering along
the dusty ruts of the road home.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
The visits of Hai t'ai-t'ai were always occasions of
intense importance to the family, and the woman, growing
frankly elderly at the early age of thirty, played her part
with such pomp and independence of manner as effectively
to inspire awe in the hearts of her needier relations.  Much
largess depended upon her smile, and all except her old
mother, who reigned haughtily like an autocrat now that
her father was dead, crowded round the t'ai-t'ai with many
questions of concern for her welfare and the health of her
body.
</p>

<p>
The headquarters of the family were in a town some
miles south of Peking, a place of dust and sand, with
streets worn far below the level of the doors.  Like all these
villages on the flat plains of Chihli, it was subject to
relentless alternation of flood and drought, so that the people
were perennially close neighbors to starvation.  They took
the fortunes of the weather philosophically, sowed crops
of millet, beans, sorghum, and wheat against the gamble
of rain, gossiped over the salt water they drew from
alkali-tainted wells, and congratulated themselves if famine
seemed no nearer than a year away.
</p>

<p>
Into this land, making a doomed resistance against the
desert which the winds each year brought closer and closer,
the t'ai-t'ai went gladly.  She did not sigh for the
extravagance of mountains, even with tempting glimpses of the
Western Hills shimmering above the mirage of the horizon.
She sat with utter contentment in the dirty hallways
of a huge ramshackle home, all decay and discomfort
behind pretentious walls, and thought nothing strange of
reducing Nancy to this, giving her pigs and chickens,
mangy dogs, slovenly women, sprawling brats for lifelong
society, courtyards reeking with the stench of manure for
her window upon the joys of the world.
</p>

<p>
Her news caused great excitement.  Fifteen thousand
taels was a large sum; remarkable was the crop of prodigies
who sprang up to claim it.  No one, of course, suggested
his own sons.  In a land where smallpox and typhus
and cholera were the normal hazards of the day, five sons
were not too great an insurance against being left without
heirs; even the likeliest boys died suddenly: one day, active
and grimy good health, the next day, a stomach ache and
the coffin.  An indiscreet fondness for melons could mow
down whole harvests of children.  No one quite took it upon
himself to offer up even the youngest of his sons as a
husband for Nancy.  They were all sure to claim their share
of the fifteen thousand taels, no matter whose son secured
it; the ingenious communism of a Chinese family guaranteed
this hope.  Why be too forward in sacrifice?  Every
father regretted the stupidity of his own offspring,
extolled unselfishly the superior talents of his nephews and
cousins.
</p>

<p>
Finally the t'ai-t'ai lost patience.
</p>

<p>
"Bah! if you found lumps of gold in your fields you
would complain about the rockiness of the soil."
</p>

<p>
Prodded by her vigorous scorn, they stumbled upon the
happy thought of asking her to suggest Nancy's suitor.
</p>

<p>
The next few days were busy ones.  The t'ai-t'ai visited
all branches of the family and hauled up the sheepish
youths to answer her questions.  Seldom in her life had the
t'ai-t'ai been in such fine fettle; she was as racy, as
outspoken as a dowager of twice her winters and paid back
arrears of jealousy and spite in the sarcasm she poured out
so freely upon the offspring of the relations who once used
to slight her.  There was not a likely candidate, she vowed,
not one whom Hai Lao-ye could not quash with a single
stern glance from above his tortoise-rimmed spectacles.
What stupid optimism their parents showed to bring up
this generation to be gentlemen.  They would gape
open-mouthed at a ricksha and fall headlong from the windows
of a railway carriage when the fire-wagon lurched forward.
Better, far better, to teach them to curse mules and
make them competent donkey-drivers; how could a full
stomach go with an empty head, long nails with an open
mouth?
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai's abuse was accepted without resentment.  It
was so impartially distributed that everyone had the chance
to grin at the discomfiture of his neighbor.  Her sarcasm
was the privilege of success.  The woman held the whip
hand over her kinsfolk in her right to dispose of fifteen
thousand taels.  There was none among them who would
not have asked the same interest from his capital.  At the
bottom of it all, they knew she was observing and when
she decided they were ready to acclaim her decision for
the t'ai-t'ai, after much sifting and searching, gave her
choice to a boy who was undeniably the ornament of the
family.
</p>

<p>
He was the son of an older brother and had surmounted
the handicaps of a mother untaught, a home ignorant of
hygiene, a family in which no one hesitated to trespass on
the privacy of others.  As though these were the conditions
necessary to producing his type, he had grown up, like so
many Chinese youths bred in the same unpromising way,
a tall, sturdy, clear-complexioned boy, with quick,
intelligent eyes, high forehead, slender, masterful hands.
</p>

<p>
She had the lad suitably clothed, brought him to Peking
with his father, installed them both in a hotel, and then
informed her husband that Nancy's match had been found.
The account she gave of his talents would have done credit
to the ablest scholar of the Han-lin.
</p>

<p>
"He must be a relative of yours," sniffed Herrick
skeptically.
</p>

<p>
"He is," acknowledged his wife.  "Why should I prefer
the treasure whose value I have known only by hearsay
when I can bring the treasure I have tested in my own
home?  He is my nephew, so I can vouch for him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am content to look at this paragon, though I
heard of no unicorn being present at his birth.  Your father
was a man of great parts; perhaps it's not impossible
some of his ability may have strained through to his
grandson."
</p>

<p>
Herrick waited for the father of the youth to call.  The
visit was promising.  Herrick had known the t'ai-t'ai's
brother in days past and was pleased to see him ripened
into a dignified, well-spoken man with the easiness of
manner which characterized training of the old school.  In due
time the son himself was produced.  Herrick noted his face
and his bearing, summoned every resource of his own
knowledge to examine him as to what he had learned of the
classics, made him write characters, interpret scrolls.  The
boy stood the ordeal well.  Every question that was put to
him he answered in a quiet, collected voice.  He looked
soberly handsome in his dark green jacket and long green
gown.  He did not shift from foot to foot or twist his
hands or venture to stare at his inquisitor.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to see that he has been taught the proprieties,"
Herrick said&mdash;the first mark of satisfaction he had
shown.
</p>

<p>
The engagement of course was not settled in a day.  It
was too grave a business for such haste.  The birthday cards
had been exchanged and the eight characters on each of
them compared, to make sure that the year, month, day,
and hour of Nancy's birth matched those of Ming-te, the
t'ai-t'ai's nephew.  The t'ai-t'ai was too wily a contriver
to be balked by a little detail of soothsaying: the making
of Nancy's card was in her own hands.  So well she managed
it that Chou Hsien-sheng, the father of the boy, was
astonished at a mating the stars themselves seemed to
have predestined.
</p>

<p>
Yet Herrick was loath to bind himself to the final
bargain.  He was satisfied with Ming-te, quite confident that
no better Chinese husband could be found for his daughter;
nevertheless, the businesslike dryness of arranging
betrothal for a girl so instinct with delicate imaginings
disheartened the father, made him sore in spirit.  He had
specified that Nancy should not be married for four years,
a point he had some trouble winning, for the fifteen thousand
taels were not to be paid till the wedding; to gain his
will here, Herrick had to concede one third of Nancy's
dowry at her engagement.  But after all the terms had been
talked out, the amount and number of betrothal presents
decided, every obstacle cleared, Herrick still hung back, for
he knew when the red cards were exchanged he should
have given up irrevocably his claims upon his daughter.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Nancy could see the boy for herself," he told
the t'ai-t'ai.  "I know my own judgment is better than hers
and that I ought to do this without a qualm&mdash;yet my
heart does not feel quite right about it."
</p>

<p>
For once in her life the t'ai-t'ai could not control a vivid
expression of her feelings.  She was appalled by her
husband's vacillating temper.  After all the concessions she
had made as matchmaker, after allowing Herrick not only
to see the father of the boy but the unprecedented privilege
of seeing the boy himself, her patience was outraged
by the mere suggestion of his turning back.
</p>

<p>
"Of course she can't see him.  How can she see him?
When has that ever been done?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Herrick agreed sadly.  It was another case of his own
inheritance betraying him.  He had fancied Nancy and
Ming-te left by themselves for a space, till the gentle
influence of the garden should help them realize their own
community of soul.  Alas, it was the fond picture of an old
man.  He needed only a minute's attention to his wife's
protests to know that neither Nancy nor Ming-te would
see the advantage of such a meeting.  They would stand
awkward, tongue-tied, wondering who should release them
from this agony of embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he said, "the matter is settled.  Call a
fortune-teller and choose a lucky day.  I am ready to make
the engagement."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai secured a lucky day close at hand.  It was
cheaper, after all, to buy a lucky day than to pay the hotel
bills of her brother and her nephew.
</p>

<p>
Herrick, meanwhile, had not dared consult Nancy about
his negotiations.  The t'ai-t'ai naturally told nothing.  It
was in her interest to be secretive, especially about the
matter of the fifteen thousand taels, which every concubine
would resent as robbing her of her chance, no matter how
remote, to plunder the family wealth.  Yet the news of the
intended engagement leaked out.  Every last woman of the
household knew who Nancy's husband was to be.  The
nurse was angry, yet afraid to make matters worse by
protesting, afraid lest she be parted from her foster
children and pensioned back to her southern home, a summary
fate she knew the t'ai-t'ai had hinted and might have
influence enough to effect by making Herrick believe he was
doing a kindness to an old and loyal family servant.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien too was perturbed.  So great was her admiration
for the shrewdness of the t'ai-t'ai that she could not
rest comfortably till she had uncovered all the inward
reasons for this engagement.  The t'ai-t'ai was not the
person to give away a favorite nephew without compensation,
not the one to argue her family into a profitless bargain.
She suspected money behind the agreement, but could
get no proof; it was certainly what she would have claimed,
had she been in the t'ai-t'ai's place.  Yet she, no more than
the amah, could presume to act against the mistress of the
household, to act openly.  The t'ai-t'ai was her patron; had
lifted her up, might yet cast her down.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien determined to provoke resistance from Nancy
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember when you suggested to your father
that I was an enemy?" she began, with engaging frankness.
"I want to prove to you that I am no enemy, but a
friend."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, who was quite unable to fathom the purpose of
the concubine, chose the prudence of keeping quiet.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know your father is seeking but a husband
for you," she continued.  "He tried Mr. Nasmith; they
couldn't come to terms.  So now your father thinks it is
cheaper to get a Chinese husband."
</p>

<p>
"Who told you all this?" Nancy asked angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my dear, the very walls have ears."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to hear the tattle of the walls."
</p>

<p>
"Come, there's no profit in being angry.  Let me finish
what I have to say.  Now your father has found a suitable
person.  He is the nephew of the t'ai-t'ai.  Why do you think
the t'ai-t'ai has offered her nephew for the place?  Because
she is fond of you?  Nonsense; it is because her family is
poor and needs the money your father is willing to pay."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the nurse herself appeared; Kuei-lien
had contrived it so.
</p>

<p>
"Now," went on the concubine, "perhaps you dislike me
too much to believe me, though I am not the enemy you
think,"&mdash;her smile truly was disarming,&mdash;"but you
surely will believe your old amah, and you will see that she
agrees with every word when I say we Chinese do not like
marriage with foreigners just as your own people look
down upon marriage with Chinese.  Isn't that so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, very true words," assented the nurse.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you marry a foreigner?" asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"I am not a wife.  I am only your father's mistress.  I
was poor.  I had no choice."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien, flinging back Nancy's own words, had shamed
the girl into silence.
</p>

<p>
"The family of your husband won't welcome you," persisted
the concubine; "they will receive you, only because
of the money you have brought, but they will hate you,
hate you; no matter how talented or how beautiful you may
be, they will hate you because you are different, they will
hate you even more because you are talented, because you
are beautiful.  What do you suppose your ignorant mother-in-law
will care about your talents?  Faugh! she cannot read
a word or write a character.  She will never rest happy till
you have forgotten every sentence you know, till you too
are like the other cattle of the house."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose all this is true," said Nancy calmly, "what is
the good of telling me?  My father makes the decisions."
</p>

<p>
"We tell you because we can do nothing with your
father.  The t'ai-t'ai would send us away if we opened our
mouths to protest.  But you have your father's ear.  The
t'ai-t'ai cannot harm you.  If you make your father
understand what this engagement means, he would love you too
much to bring such shame upon his daughter.  Go and see
him.  According to your Western custom you have the
right to speak about these things."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing about Western customs," Nancy replied,
"but I do know this: my father hasn't sent for me
and he hasn't asked my advice.  There is nothing I can say
till he asks me."
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had made the two women realize that she
was not going to lift the littlest finger against a fate which
was not yet real to her mind, Nancy escaped to join
Edward and Li-an in the garden.  October sunshine glowed
lazily through the trees, striking silky lights from the
cobwebs.  Nancy sat down in the little summer house which
seemed to brood with her on the coming loneliness of
winter; she kicked her feet through the crinkly leaves and
looked at the bright borders of the chrysanthemums which
tossed their curled petals like a rainbow of flame around
her.  She had wanted to stay like this forever&mdash;forever&mdash;yet
now had come this new, unwanted intrusion to prove
the rightness of her father's words.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Nancy?" asked Edward, as he and
Li-an came in and stood beside her.  "Why don't you come
and play?"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to be engaged."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," Li-an joined in proudly.  "Just as soon as
you're betrothed, mother's going to find a fiancé for me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we all have to be engaged," Edward agreed, "it's
nothing to cry about.  Perhaps they'll have a feast."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say such stupid things, Edward?  You
never think about anything but your stomach.  Do you
think I have to be engaged just so you can stuff yourself?
I hate you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you really want to?" asked Edward with concern.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not."
</p>

<p>
The boy was taken aback by his sister's willingness to
forgo an occasion of such promising excitement.  But
Nancy got rid of Li-an and told her brother all the
dreadful prophecies Kuei-lien had made.  Edward had never
thought of an engagement in this light.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go see father," declared the boy.  "I'll tell him you
aren't ready to be engaged."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, despite herself, smiled at his unconventional
daring, but she did not stop him.  It was an act Edward
never before had thought of doing, to go thus uninvited
to his father's room.  Yet no prudence deterred him, no
thought of hesitation even came into his mind.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you wish, Edward?" asked Herrick, who
was sitting at his desk.  He always derived tender
amusement from the animated, serious ways of his son.
</p>

<p>
"Does Nancy have to be engaged now?" asked the boy,
plunging into his subject with an Occidental directness for
which there was no explanation except the blood in his
veins, loyally Western despite all the sages of China.  "She
doesn't want to be engaged."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want her to be engaged either," replied the
father sadly, "but time takes these affairs out of my
hands."
</p>

<p>
As if to prove the truth of his statement there came
suddenly the long blast of a trumpet, the lilt of wind
instruments like the festival sprightliness of bagpipes, then a
tremendous explosion of firecrackers, long strings of them
bursting with redoubled noise in the confines of the
hallway.
</p>

<p>
"You hear," indicated Herrick with a weary gesture.
Time had indeed taken the affair out of his hands.
</p>

<p>
The father paced restlessly up and down the room
while the noise continued.  Edward's curiosity impelled the
boy to join the crowd of women and servants gathered in
the courtyard.  The t'ai-t'ai had kept her secret so well that
only the father had been prepared for the coming of the
betrothal gifts, only the father had been allowed to see
the trays of return gifts got ready in an outer room of the
house.
</p>

<p>
Amid the smoke and turmoil of crackers six pairs of
coolies entered, each pair carrying between them a red
wooden tray laden with bales of silk and cotton, with rice,
with round pears and balls of steamed bread, and with
dried poultry on which had been pasted double characters
cut out of red paper to represent the word for happiness;
there were eggs too, dyed red, and slippers of silver
paper.  The overslung handles of the trays had been
festooned with garlands of red cloth.
</p>

<p>
All the middle doors had been flung open so that the
coolies could bring their hampers into the inner courtyards,
while people from the street mixed with people of the
household, thronging the pavements despite the belaboring
curses of the gatemen.  The t'ai-t'ai, who wore resplendently
a skirt of scarlet brocaded satin, stood beaming
with importance, ready to receive the gifts and to
dispatch Nancy's in return.  The consummation of arduous
diplomacy was symbolized by her sedate manner,
the dignity which no Chinese woman is too humble
to reserve for the few great public moments of her
life.
</p>

<p>
But she had to share the haughty fruits of the occasion.
A gasp from the women standing round caused her to
turn and to see Nancy, who of all people in the world had
no business to be there.  Already, in noisy undertones, the
women were commenting upon Nancy's immodest presumption
in coming out so brazenly to receive her betrothal
gifts when she ought to be hiding in some adjacent
room, pretending ignorance of the festive proceedings.
Nancy did not hear them, did not seem to mind the asperity
of the t'ai-t'ai's voice, when the reason for her being there
was demanded.
</p>

<p>
"This is my betrothal, is it?" the girl asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And these are my betrothal gifts?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stooped and looked at the contents of the trays.
There was no limit to her unmaidenly boldness.
</p>

<p>
"Very nice things they are," she commented, "and where
are the things I am to send?"
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai could not speak; she merely indicated with
her chin the other trays which had been brought from the
gate.  The girl walked round them slowly, looked with a
meditative gaze on the articles which had been heaped upon
them, then very deliberately took two of the large golden
chrysanthemums she was carrying and placed them on
top of the foremost tray.
</p>

<p>
"I want one gift to come from me," she said.

CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
After Nancy's departure, the ceremonies again could
take their appointed course.  The firecrackers blazed and
snapped, the little horns, with voices like thin piping
clarionets, again commenced their weird din, the trumpets
blew; away went the trays, with Nancy's own bright gift,
to the home of her future husband.  Now came men who
wore scarlet sashes, to bring the large red document
revealing in its eight gold characters the celestial ordinance
beneath which Ming-te had been born; two others took
away with them Nancy's eight characters, putting her
destiny eternally into the keeping of her betrothed.
</p>

<p>
In these things Nancy took no part.  She returned to the
garden and listened to the exulting turmoil with ears that
understood its meaning less than the resonant whisper of
the pines.  The flowers, nodding together their
many-colored heads, made her homesick for the mountains and
summer sunshine.  She wondered where her poor token
would go, her golden-hued chrysanthemums, her one small
effort to ask pity and love from a youth she had never
seen.  Would those unvalued blossoms come by some
extreme chance to his eyes and tell him that she had sent
them?  No, he would not see the flowers; they might have
fallen bedraggled into the streets; he could see only the
gaudy, costly things, the silk, the cloth, the slippers, things
the t'ai-t'ai had got ready without any reference to her.  He
had sent her no token, no sign, just inanimate rubbish.  And
yet it was this cold stranger who was receiving the
precious eight characters, the red cards Nancy knew with a
superstitious shudder were being taken away like some
virtue gone out of her.
</p>

<p>
Nancy contemplated these matters with a gentle bitterness.
From years back this hour had been inevitable; perhaps
she had been spoiled by its having been so long delayed.
She could not complain, but her heart was sad, filled
with foreboding of that second more sinister hour when
she must be locked into the scarlet bridal chair.  When that
hour should come, whether soon or late, she had no clue.
But she was betrothed; it must come in the end.  She must
walk now a straitened path, never again to see Elizabeth
and Helen&mdash;or Mr. Nasmith, never again with the heart
to fling cones from the high branches of the pines upon her
laughing, vexed brother.
</p>

<p>
Winter came; the garden was parched and bleak.  When
the children went out to play in the cold dry sunshine they
wore thickly padded garments which transformed them
into stuffed dummies, a misshapen caricature of the cool
clean limbs and lithe bodies that had made the pine tree
their own kingdom in July.
</p>

<p>
Nancy accepted her lot.  She got great comfort in learning
by an indirect message from her father that there was
to be no marriage for four whole years.  Much might
intervene in four years, so she did not demur at the new task
of sewing for her trousseau; after the first shock it became
like any other sewing and the boy a shadowy, almost
legendary, figure only vaguely able to threaten her
happiness from a distant horizon.
</p>

<p>
Herrick alone was morose.  He had regretted the engagement
before it was made; afterward he regretted it more.
He lost sleep.  The peace he had hoped to buy became more
elusive than ever because all the time Kuei-lien was
torturing him by little subtle ironies upon the life to which he
was dooming Nancy.  Her words came so innocently that
the man never guessed the intent behind them.  He did
know this: that he was a prey to nightmare, to dreams in
which Nancy's mother and the amah and Nasmith all were
inextricably mixed, the one burden of their tongues and
their eyes being the evil he had done.  He was becoming a
haunted man, and no matter how desperately he might
fight to preserve his wits, to keep his mind and his strength
for the sake of his children, there was a point beyond
which flesh and nerves could not endure; he gave way with
a crash, like the rending of a great tree, and for days
offered himself to Kuei-lien to be trampled on.
</p>

<p>
When he emerged, everyone in the house knew that he
was a sick man.  He did not regain his poise with the old
alertness, did not even struggle to regain it, but lay back,
shaking, infirm, afraid to move lest he provoke one of his
terrible spasms of the heart.
</p>

<p>
"You are killing him," protested the t'ai-t'ai to Kuei-lien.
For so many years she had been used to Herrick's
moderate indulgence in opium and kao-liang spirits that she
had not realized her husband's self-control could relax
with such speed.  A hale and hearty old age anyone would
have predicted for Timothy Herrick, yet here was death
written on his face.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai had not prepared for this.  She could not
afford to let Herrick die now, with Nancy unmarried, the
ten thousand taels undelivered, worse than all, Herrick's
fortune, of which no one knew the exact amount, locked
up in that mysterious, impregnable place, the English bank,
whence only Herrick's magically written slips of paper
could draw forth the silver stream.  The woman, of course,
knew nothing of law or banking practice; of her own accord
she would not have trusted a copper behind the brass
grille of a bank.  If Herrick died, she feared every cent he
possessed might be taken out of her grasp.  She could not
write checks; even for Nancy's dowry she had no security.
Her only hopes were to marry Nancy while her father
lived and to persuade him into transferring his wealth from
inaccessible bank vaults to the tangible form which had
served her forefathers, into gold ornaments and pearls, and
ingots snugly buried in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"You are killing him," she warned Kuei-lien.  "A man of
his years cannot stand these excesses."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the concubine, with a touch of insolence she
had never shown before, "do you credit me with being the
mistress?  If my master commands, what can I do but
obey?  His is the will, not mine."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai opened her ears at this tart remark.  She
looked narrowly at Kuei-lien, wondering whether this last
and least of her husband's concubines were using her favor
to rob an infatuated man.  The shrewd suspicion entered
her mind that Kuei-lien was utilizing these frenzies of
sordid passion, when Herrick's senses were bemuddled, to
extract money from her master, to extract those formidable
little slips of paper.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you may rest for a while.  Your master is too sick
for excitement.  I will look after him," she said.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien nodded and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to send her away or sell her," thought the
t'ai-t'ai.  "This kind of business can't go on."
</p>

<p>
She took rigorous charge of her husband, put him in bed,
administered homely Chinese medicines, refused to let
anyone see him.  So languid was Herrick's mood that the man
acquiesced, only complaining in an occasional peevish
sentence because Kuei-lien had not come to see him.  During
the stupor which possessed him the t'ai-t'ai found it easy
to get his keys and she pulled out the check book in which
she had seen him write.  It had been his habit to draw out
limited sums each month, giving the checks to be cashed by
an old and recognized servant.  The woman took the book,
looked at the stubs crosswise and upside down, but could
make neither head nor tail of them.  Finally she sought
Edward's help.
</p>

<p>
"Your father is not well and wants you to help me with
some business," she explained.  "Will you read what is
written here."
</p>

<p>
After some confusion between the numbers of the
checks, the dates, and the sums, Edward found the gist
of the story the stubs told and soon was able to translate
the monthly record, "To cash, such and such a sum," "To
cash, such and such a sum," while the t'ai-t'ai noted the
figures in her memory.  Then appeared what she suspected,
checks for sums she had never received.  They began in the
summer and continued through the autumn.  She had Edward
repeat them again and again till the figures were
printed indelibly on her mind.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai pondered this new problem at some length.
She was quite certain that Kuei-lien could not have cashed
checks for such large amounts without enlisting the help
of her husband's old messenger.  This faithful man had
been associated so invariably with the process of getting
money that the woman had come to believe his participation
was an unalterable step in the procedure.  He was not
the man to be bribed in a day; the t'ai-t'ai was reasonably
certain of his honesty.  The probability then was that
Kuei-lien still held the checks and was waiting a favorable
chance to exchange them.
</p>

<p>
When once the t'ai-t'ai had reached this conclusion, her
first impulse was to call the concubine to her husband and
in her absence to search every corner of her boxes, every
corner of her room; if this failed, to summon two strong
servants, strip the girl, and search every article of her
clothing.  It was probably on her body that Kuei-lien would
carry the checks.
</p>

<p>
"I should have to sell her after that," the woman decided.
</p>

<p>
Second thought, however, was more deliberate, not from
any pity for Kuei-lien, but because there certainly would
be scandal; the story would reach Herrick's ears&mdash;the
t'ai-t'ai could trust her enemies for that&mdash;and no one
knew what vengeance the man might exact, in his weakened,
peevish condition, for the loss of a favorite concubine.
Even this the angry woman might have risked, if the
thought had not occurred to her that by making terms with
Kuei-lien she could use the wiles of the concubine to get
even larger sums from her husband, to get the money he
always laughingly had insisted was safe, into the only safe
form the t'ai-t'ai recognized, the safety of good, tangible
silver.  Yes, the concubine was worth winning over; she
could do this; she might even persuade the old man to
allow an earlier marriage for Nancy.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai went to Kuei-lien's room and found the
concubine seated cross-legged on the k'ang, the brick oven
which served for divan and bed.  She was smoking cigarettes,
her incessant habit.  At the t'ai-t'ai's entry, however,
she jumped up, brought her mistress to the k'ang, and only
after repeated urging by the t'ai-t'ai consented to sit on
the warm rush mats beside her.  There was much desultory
talk during which the older woman searched Kuei-lien's
appearance with keen eyes to see if she had acquired any
unusual jewelry; Kuei-lien was fastidiously dressed, rather
daringly, with short full trousers barely topping a
startling length of cerise stocking, but there were no signs of
jewelry.  This was some evidence that the checks had not
been cashed.  Finally, when the time seemed ripe, the
t'ai-t'ai became more direct in her speech.  She had steered
the conversation to the subject of Herrick's ill health.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity he will go to these excesses," Kuei-lien
agreed.  "I can do nothing to stop him when the passion
comes over him.  Hai&mdash;at times I am afraid.  He becomes
like a madman and strikes me if I try to take his opium
pipe away."
</p>

<p>
"Does he ever pay you for these blows?" asked the
t'ai-t'ai shrewdly.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien winced a little.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, he pays me," she laughed, "pays me with
bruises.  I will show you my back; it is black and blue."
</p>

<p>
"He pays you with nothing more substantial?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even a ring has he given me."
</p>

<p>
"No, not a ring, but little pieces of paper, little pieces of
paper which you have not been able to exchange for money.
Wouldn't you like Lao Yang's assistance to cash them?"
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien's face grew red with a blush the girl could
not check, but she held her body from a second telltale
jerk.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand what you mean," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Come now," protested the t'ai-t'ai, "you can't deny that
you received checks for these amounts."  She reeled off
from memory the sums and dates of the checks she was
certain Kuei-lien had received.
</p>

<p>
"What should I do with checks?" asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
"That's just the point," the t'ai-t'ai smiled in return;
"what should you do with them?  They are useless in their
present form and you will never be permitted to change
them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about these things," Kuei-lien
persisted stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
"Just think a little," her mistress went on in the same
bland voice, "and don't try to keep up appearances before
me.  Who brought you up, may I ask?  Who saved you
from being a slattern in the scullery at this very moment?
It's worth remembering, because the same person who
lifted you to your present favor can throw you down
again."  The t'ai-t'ai allowed a minute for these words to
have their effect while she looked round the room.  "You
are very comfortable here," she remarked, "you have prospered
well for the short time you have been here&mdash;well-filled
boxes, plenty of clothes; I have indeed been generous
to you.  It would be a pity to lose them all."
</p>

<p>
"They are yours," admitted Kuei-lien.  "I have no claim
to them.  Take them."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, don't try that game of candor with me," said the
woman.  "I am not threatening, mind you.  I am simply
appealing to your reasonableness.  I should be sorely
disappointed if the protégée over whom I have taken such
pains proved to be merely a clever fool.  Just let me
imagine two pictures for you.  On the one hand you cling
obstinately to little bits of paper for which you never can
get a copper cent.  What do I do?  I call in two strong men
who are waiting outside; they tie a piece of cloth across
your mouth so as not to disturb the household unnecessarily,
then they twist your arms so&mdash;and so; do you
think you wouldn't soon be anxious to point out these
worthless checks?  Or they ransack these boxes, take off
these pretty clothes, and cut the linings away with scissors;
don't you think we could find them even if you had to
stand stark naked watching us?  What good would you get
of your stubbornness?  Just the pleasure of being sold back
to be a slave again.  That's one picture," concluded the
t'ai-t'ai, as though she had been telling a story.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien listened in startled attention, quite hypnotized
by the woman's smooth voice.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the other side, a much more cheerful picture.
We'll imagine you giving me these checks.  Lao Yang, at
my orders, will cash them.  Of that money I will give you
one fourth.  You may think that is too little, but it is more
than you could get in any other way; it is much more than
nothing.  The best part of it is, you have the chance of
earning more money on the same terms.  It is not wrong.
The Great Man is not well, as you know, and he is stubborn
about keeping his money in a foreign bank.  He
thinks he can provide for us in time, but I know his
disease: pfui! in a moment he's gone&mdash;like a candle blown
out.  If he dies, what becomes of us?  Is it our fault for
snatching what safeguards we can?  Well, that's the other
picture.  You may not be contented with a fourth, but you'll
like it better than being sold to a brothel.  I am not easy
with those who betray me."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien showed her mettle by smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do like the second picture better," she said, "it
is drawn very well.  Do you offer me this picture?"
</p>

<p>
"I offer it&mdash;and I shall add a few more colors on the
day Nancy marries my nephew.  You have had your own
game there, I know," she remarked cheerfully, "but your
game is a risky one.  I don't blame you for trying your
own plans, but you were trying for all or nothing.  While
I'm here, it would have been nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Kuei-lien.  "I accept your offer."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad my judgment has been vindicated.  I had
begun to fear you were just like the common trash who
remain slaves all their lives.  They think they are clever
because the cat doesn't stop them when they go to snatch
rice from the trap.  You are sensible; you understand that
there is profit in being grateful."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien answered the t'ai-t'ai by unbuttoning her
jacket and loosening her clothes till she could reach the
narrow girdle bound next to her skin.  Pulling it out, she
cut the threads and extracted five folded slips of paper.
</p>

<p>
"That is the proper number," said the t'ai-t'ai.  "I will
bring you a fourth of this sum to-morrow.  Remember, you
have a free hand.  I will see that no one interferes with you.
Don't be too hasty, don't drive the Great Man to excess;
then there should be many more of these."
</p>

<p>
Calmly she bowed herself out.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
By one shrewd stroke the t'ai-t'ai had regained Kuei-lien's
faltering allegiance.  She was very happy over the effects
of her skill and particularly pleased at her discernment in
the choice of an agent.  The concubine had won more than
she had lost in the admiration of her mistress.  Any ordinary
girl, caught thieving, as the t'ai-t'ai termed Kuei-lien's
machinations, would have held stubbornly to her story and
forced a final violent exposure.  It took genius to give way
before the inevitable.  Kuei-lien had that uncommon genius.
So the new alliance thrived on a mutual respect and
understanding.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien saw that for the present at least her fortune
consisted in loyalty to her mistress.  She paid her dividends,
as it were, by skillfully teasing Herrick into health and out
of it, never letting him lose the need of her or grow sated,
and inveigling him more and more easily into the gifts of
money which the man granted now almost from force of
habit.  After the first marked change from the robustness
of his former days, there were few further signs of decline.
The man was sinking, but sinking imperceptibly.  He ceased
to see much of his children: he would see them to-morrow,&mdash;so
he told himself day after day,&mdash;but each new morning
there was the plea of illness.
</p>

<p>
The truth was that Herrick was afraid of death, afraid
to provoke those terrible spasms of pain which he laid
wrong-headedly enough to worry over Nancy's affairs;
he was satisfied to stop thinking and surrender to the
lulling security of the senses, to a desire for Kuei-lien's
presence, which overpowered every thought of duty, every
wish.  So week by week his strength and his money drifted
away; week by week the t'ai-t'ai and Kuei-lien buried their
three fourths and one fourth of his treasure.
</p>

<p>
They could not wholly conceal their secret.  There were
others too intimately involved in the state of Herrick's
health not to watch jealously the spoils that Hai t'ai-t'ai
and Kuei-lien were taking.  Nancy and Edward went their
way in ignorance, but to the three other concubines it was
a matter of life and death.  If Herrick died, they would be
the property of the t'ai-t'ai without a cent or a right of
their own.  Time was slipping past.  Herrick seemed to have
forgotten they existed; he never called for them.  Even
when the third and fourth concubines bore sons in quick
succession, Herrick did not come.  The t'ai-t'ai heaped
presents upon this auspicious progeny, gave great feasts
for each of the babies at the end of their first month, but
the father did not appear.  He was too ill.  The second wife
read the message of this dissimulated kindness and knew
correctly that the more the mistress of the household
showered them with gifts, the greater wrong she was doing
them behind their backs.
</p>

<p>
At last she saw no recourse except to appeal to Nancy.
The English children were the only ones who could demand
access to Herrick.  With great caution the second wife
discarded her old policy of holding aloof from these Westerners,
knowing that the t'ai-t'ai might be alive to the first
hints of an uncommon friendship.  She bided her time till
she caught her enemies at a discreet distance, then she
came out frankly, volubly, with the whole story of what
Nancy's stepmother and fifth wife were managing.
</p>

<p>
"They are killing your father and robbing him, and they
are going to sell you to the t'ai-t'ai's nephew."
</p>

<p>
"But the t'ai-t'ai and Kuei-lien are not friends,"
exclaimed Nancy, taken aback by these sudden confidences.
"Kuei-lien tried to prevent my engagement&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Till she got her price.  Now they are fond as thieves.
Everybody knows it.  None of us is blind except your
father.  They keep him sick so that they can wheedle
money out of him.  They will screw thousands of taels out
of him for your wedding&mdash;that will go to the t'ai-t'ai's
family, and you'll be married in a year."
</p>

<p>
"That can't be.  It's arranged that I shall not be married
for four years."
</p>

<p>
"Four years, bah!  Don't you think they can persuade
a dying man into hastening such a happy event?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely he is not dying!" she exclaimed in great agitation.
</p>

<p>
"He is dying," affirmed the woman; "his brain is nearly
dead now; his body will soon follow."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stared with immensely opened eyes as though she
saw the whole terrible scene before her.  She had forgotten
to sit down.  Her hands took a firmer grip on the chair
behind which she stood.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" she asked in a strangely quiet
voice.
</p>

<p>
"We!" exclaimed the visitor.  "We can do nothing.  If
the t'ai-t'ai so much as heard that I had been to see you, off
she would pack me to-morrow.  You have four friends,
every one of us helpless.  You have two bitter enemies.
It is just as much your battle as ours.  You can see your
father; we cannot.  If anyone is to do anything, it must be
you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are right," said Nancy, remembering her
encounter with Kuei-lien in the Western Hills.  "I will do
something.  And no one shall know you asked me."
</p>

<p>
This interview gave an ultimate touch to the change
which the experiences of the last few months had wrought
in Nancy.  She examined her chances of grief open-eyed,
prepared to meet them with the simplicity of courage which
came natural to her steady heart.
</p>

<p>
The first step was to supplant Kuei-lien and the t'ai-t'ai
in their dominance over her father.  She moved so
swiftly that the two conspirators were astonished to find
the girl installed in her father's room.  Herrick, with
pathetic docility, childlike in its readiness to be pleased by
trifles, surrendered himself wholly to the mastery of a
strong will.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien protested that Nancy would do injury to her
father's delicate health by so uncalled-for an intrusion.
</p>

<p>
"My father is ill," replied the daughter.  "It would be
wrong for me to waste my time playing when he needs my
help.  It is time I took some share in my duties instead of
leaving all the hardship to you."
</p>

<p>
"But you have had no experience; you don't know how
to take care of him."
</p>

<p>
"I can learn.  He will be glad of a change and so will
you."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien knew Nancy's obstinacy too well to waste more
time in futile dispute.  She hastened to tell the t'ai-t'ai the
alarming turn Nancy's action had caused.
</p>

<p>
"We can't separate them," she exclaimed.  "The miserable
girl has had her bedding moved into a room next to the
Great Man's and says she will live there till he is well.
What can we do?"
</p>

<p>
"We've got to get her married," said the t'ai-t'ai;
"there will be no peace till she's gone.  Suppose he dies
because of her folly; we shall be left like beggars."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't get her married.  She won't obey us.  She
will obey her father, but she won't listen to us."
</p>

<p>
"It's my own stupidity," moaned the t'ai-t'ai.  "I should
never have allowed that old hag of a nurse to remain; I
should have taught these two young demons to obey me
when they were young.  She put these conceited notions into
their heads, taught them to lord it over us as though we
were dust for their feet to trample.  You must persuade the
Great Man to hasten the wedding of his daughter; you
must find some way.  Ah, if I can only get her locked into
her red chair and safe in my brother's house, I'll show
them how to handle the vixen.  She'll be a tamed
daughter-in-law if they follow my advice!  A stick&mdash;that's what
the hussy needs, till she's glad to beat clothes at the
pond and clean my brother's pipes."
</p>

<p>
"Very entertaining thoughts," Kuei-lien scoffed, "but
not very helpful just now."
</p>

<p>
They were, in truth, far from helpful.  Nancy had
learned her lesson and quarantined her father from his too
solicitous concubine with the coolness and resource of
which she could thank Kuei-lien for teaching her the trick.
She would not be enticed from her father's door, and day
after day her excuse for this usurpation became greater
because it was undeniable that she was nursing the exhausted
man slowly back to strength.
</p>

<p>
At last the t'ai-t'ai had to intervene, an act she was most
reluctant to do, preferring always, as a politic woman, to
remain in the background.  Nancy did not dare to stop her
from an interview with her father and retired when she
saw that the wife wished to be alone with her husband.
For a long time the door remained shut.  She could hear
the t'ai-t'ai talking indistinguishable sentences in a low
rapid voice.  Occasionally a laugh was audible.  As no
immediate conclusion to this talk seemed likely, Nancy took
the chance to fetch some clothes from her room.  She was
not gone many minutes.  To her relief she found the door
still shut, and the conversation still continuing.  But after
an hour the girl became restless.  No answer was paid
to her knock.  She tried the door; it was bolted.  Not till
she had beaten upon the wooden panels for several minutes
did anyone deign to take notice.  The door was pulled
ajar; the girl saw to her amazement the face of Kuei-lien.
</p>

<p>
"Your father is feeling better now," said the concubine,
"and has sent for me to take your place.  He wants you to
rest."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't wish to rest," protested Nancy, "and, if
my father gives orders, I take them from him, not from
you."
</p>

<p>
Before Kuei-lien could stop her, she had pushed her way
into the room.  In the few minutes she had been gone, not
only the concubine had been smuggled into the place, but
the glasses, bottles, pipe, all the vicious instruments she
had been so wakeful to keep out of her father's grasp.
For the first time in her life she forgot her father's
presence in her rage at the duplicity practised by the
concubine.
</p>

<p>
"This is the way you look after a sick man, is it?" she
cried.  "Take these things away."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien did not move.
</p>

<p>
"Have you lost all respect for your father?" she asked
in the correct tones of a schoolmistress chiding a naughty
pupil.  Then she turned to Herrick on his couch.  "Now
you see what she's like," she said, as if to justify some
previous remarks.  "Do you wonder that none of us can
do anything with her when she tries to rule even her father
with these haughty ways?"
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to make my father well.  She is trying to
make him ill," groaned Nancy, addressing her father in
desperation.  Kuei-lien snorted in bitter amusement.
</p>

<p>
"What profit would there be for me in making him ill?
Doesn't my life depend upon his?  Do I wish to be turned
away like a penniless beggar?"
</p>

<p>
"This has gone far enough," protested Herrick, rousing
himself to the distasteful duty of interference.  "You are
both wrong to quarrel in this shameless way."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's self-possession had been too sorely tested in
recent days.  She could not hold back tears of vexation at
hearing her words dismissed as a vulgar quarrel.
</p>

<p>
"Oh my father, they are killing you, killing you, and
robbing you!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien scoffed.
</p>

<p>
"A nice imagination your daughter has," she said.  "She
has borrowed too many novels from her old amah."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it the truth?" demanded Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, of course it's the truth if you insist upon it.
Your father is so helpless, isn't he, that he must need his
seventeen-year-old daughter for a nurse to protect him!"
</p>

<p>
Herrick had grown more and more uncomfortable; this
bickering was compromising his dignity, making him a
laughingstock.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now, Nancy," he said soothingly, "you are saying
quite unjustifiable things.  Your feelings are carrying
away your sense of reason.  Kuei-lien is right.  I am not a
child."
</p>

<p>
"Make her take those things away," Nancy persisted,
determined upon one last stubborn appeal.  "She is only
trying to harm you.  I am&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be still," her father interrupted curtly.  "I have had
enough of this, do you understand?  You have done your
duty, you have taken care of me when I was ill.  But it is
no part of your duty to advise your father.  Who has been
teaching you such presumptuous manners?  If I need you
again, I shall call for you; until I do so, I don't want you
coming here making these disgraceful scenes.  I won't hear
of such ungovernable interference with my own will&mdash;and
that from a chit of a girl."
</p>

<p>
"Her boldness is becoming intolerable," commented
Kuei-lien, as Nancy silently withdrew.  This was one word
too many for Herrick's ruffled temper.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were as honest as she is," he said.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had won this much of a victory in blighting Kuei-lien's
charms for the moment.  Deep irritation settled on
Herrick at the thought of this wordy brawl between
concubine and daughter, a brawl they had waged as though
his presence, his judgment, did not matter.  They had
treated him like a weakling.  The irritation stung and
rankled because the man knew too well his own cowardice
was at the bottom of it, his cowardice and his vanity,
which had kept him from supporting Nancy in her appeal
to his best instincts.  Nancy had said wild things, of course,
but there was no doubt she believed all that she had said
and it was more than possible that these wild guesses
passed for truth in the women's quarters; Herrick had
gained insight enough, after his years of multiple weddedness,
to know some of the jealous currents that animated
the course of life in his household.  He did not appreciate
a tenth of the actual facts, but he was beginning to see that
his wives were not of one mind and that they were subject
to natural fears as to what might become of them and their
children if he died.
</p>

<p>
"I'll settle it once and for all," he decided, astonishing
the household by calling for his chair.  In Peking sedan
chairs were becoming out-dated relics of the past; motor
cars rushed everywhere and the wide, dusty streets were
full of elegant rickshas, commodious enough for the fat
officials who sat in stupid composure while their outrunners
pushed and shouted a rapid way for them through the
traffic.  But Herrick would have none of these.  He
preferred the dignity of his heavy blue chair, which four
bearers carried in state while his Chinese secretary,
bringing cards, scuffled hastily in his wake.
</p>

<p>
The chair coolies finally halted before the gate of an
ugly building, a grim and cheerless structure imitated in
gray brick from the most disheartening of Western models.
Herrick loathed the penal appearance of the place.
After some hesitation he sent in cards for Mr. Ronald
Nasmith.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
For a second time, after all his years in Peking, Herrick
was denying the sureness of the root which his life had
taken in alien soil, by turning to a casually met stranger
from the West for help he looked in vain to obtain from
his adopted countrymen.
</p>

<p>
"This is a hideous place," he remarked, scanning the
dirty whitewashed walls of the guestroom into which
Nasmith had ushered him.  "You don't live here, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"No, thank God."
</p>

<p>
"This is the blight our Western ways put upon China.
How can you instruct students in a hole like this?  These
places make me more anti foreign than the Chinese themselves.
I should like to sweep all of you into the sea; I
can see too well the beauty you are desecrating."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith thought to himself that the reverse might also
be true.  He had spent an unquiet winter.  He had never
ceased debating the choice Herrick had given him, as
though the offer still lay open for his decision.  It was
futile, useless debate, a purely academic distraction from
which no profit could be gained, yet it continued to wound
him.  Nancy had cast a spell of vivid charm over all his
family; she had won their hearts by an interest which long
outlasted the summer, a charm which hung over them like
a receding shadow so that they lived almost with bated
breath beneath the fascination of her mystery, wondering
where she was, what she was doing and&mdash;this they felt
but feared to mention aloud&mdash;what perils she might be
facing with the steadfast dark eyes they remembered so
tenderly.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith's particular recollections were still more
poignant because Herrick's unconventional offer, the curious
phrasing of his scrolls, upon which the offer had shed some
light, made him feel that Nancy's life was bound to his by
a fateful sympathy which would persist even though it were
balked of all real fulfillment.  Yet even now, attracted to a
Nancy who was almost a legend, he could not make up his
mind to accept, if her father renewed the proposal.
</p>

<p>
He might have spared himself these worries.  The older
man set that issue at rest by his next words.
</p>

<p>
"I have come on a matter of business," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Business?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I want your help in something I have postponed
for years, something I hoped I might never have to do: it
smacks too much of your dreary Western formality.  But
I know, now, my mind will be easier when it's done.  I want
to make my will."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't there any provisions for a will in the Chinese
customs you like so well?" asked Nasmith, smiling ironically
as he spoke.  "Surely the Chinese, after four thousand
years, have devised some way of leaving their treasure
behind them.  Or have they excelled us again and
learned how to lay up their gold and silver in Heaven?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they have their ways," admitted Herrick, ignoring
Nasmith's sneer; "the family inherits the money and attends
to its just distribution.  That is of no use to me,
however, for I have no family."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you?  I thought you were a shining example
of the family man."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes; but all women.  They would tear each other
in pieces if I put any money in their hands.  It's only
men who can manage these matters."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is a misfortune that you should not have been
born Chinese.  That would have solved many difficulties.
But what advice am I worthy to give you?  If you, with
all your years in China, can't leave your money
satisfactorily, how can my limited experience be of use?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not seeking advice; I want you to be my&mdash;what
do you call it?&mdash;executor, and keep my will, and see that
my property is fairly distributed.  I seem bound to ask
favors of you.  This is no easy one, I know, but perhaps it
is easier than the last.  If I live long enough, it may cost
you no trouble at all."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't?"
</p>

<p>
"Then I admit frankly you will have the devil of a time.
You'll have to apportion certain sums, which I shall
specify, among several women, each of whom will think you
are robbing her.  But, once you've done it, you're rid of
them.  They can gamble away their share in a night if they
wish without your being under any obligation to interfere.
I don't expect you to take this trouble without being paid
for it; I insist upon that, though I know that will not be a
consideration to you if you really wish to help me; but I
wouldn't ask my own brother to make so large a gift of
his time and patience without some reward, so please don't
protest.  Your most exacting burden will be keeping an
eye upon my boy, Edward.  If he's twenty-one before I
die, well and good: you'll have no responsibility.  If he's
younger, he'll need some direction."
</p>

<p>
"What about Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Nancy&mdash;she is arranged for; I won't bother you
with that responsibility again.  She is to get her share when
she's married."
</p>

<p>
"Married!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've found a good husband for her.  How could I
rest easy with that responsibility on my mind?  Let's hope,
my dear sir, that when you're married you will have only
sons.  You'll have more sleep, less worry.  It is too great
a strain to have the future of growing daughters on one's
mind."
</p>

<p>
"But when is she to be married?" asked Nasmith, trying
to keep his voice level.
</p>

<p>
"That I can't say.  Not for four years, I hope.  You
remember the terms you found too extravagant.  If I find
my strength failing, I shall hasten it.  If anything should
happen too suddenly, that is, if she should fail to be
married before I die, then I shall have to ask you to
hand over her marriage portion.  But I shall leave no
stone unturned to spare you such a disagreeable necessity."
</p>

<p>
"Then she is to marry a Chinese?" asked Nasmith,
scarcely brave enough to hear the answer.
</p>

<p>
"She is engaged to a Chinese."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith did not pursue this topic further.  There were
too many thoughts to be uttered; he did not know which to
select.  The shame, the wrongfulness of the father's
action choked him, but he remembered that he had been
warned.  He had refused his chance and felt honor-bound
not to protest, now that Herrick had disposed of his
daughter in a way which seemed to him so utterly
appalling.  He knew, also, how unavailing protests would be,
how deaf the ears upon which they would fall.  A betrothal
in China was too binding, too sacred a compact to be
dissolved by the persuasion of a moment.  So he kept silent,
preferring not to waste words.
</p>

<p>
Disappointment over Herrick's relentless execution of a
threat he himself never had taken seriously made him all
the more willing to accept this second trust the man had
sought from him.  He would be able to follow events in this
weird family, still more to assume some responsibility for
them; perhaps Nancy's tragic case was not hopeless&mdash;some
stubborn cell of his brain would not be reconciled to
accepting it as hopeless&mdash;he might yet, he must, have his
part to play, his chance to intervene.  In one breath he
prayed that Herrick might live to be ninety and that
Nancy's affianced bridegroom be struck down by all the
plagues of the East.
</p>

<p>
"This time," he told Herrick, "I can help you.  I shall
be glad to act as your executor, but I hope the necessity
of doing so may never arise&mdash;at least not for many
years."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Herrick gravely, "you have taken a
great load off my mind.  Now we must have witnesses, and
the will, of course, must be left with you.  It would never
do to put it where others can tamper with it."
</p>

<p>
"I can get witnesses: Mr. Beresford should do, and my
brother-in-law&mdash;he is a banker.  I am sure he will be
useful."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Can you bring them to my house?  Here is my
card.  I will write the address in English, if you wish.
Could you come, say, at five to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we could."
</p>

<p>
Herrick departed, greatly pleased at the granting of his
request and not without regretful thoughts over having
lost what seemed a predestined husband for Nancy.  What,
after all, was the training he had boasted of giving his
daughter?  Months had gone.  Except during his spell of
illness, he had scarcely seen the girl.  He began to feel
that he had sacrificed her for an inconsiderable point.  The
thought was too painful.  It was better to be philosophic,
to say that what was to be would be despite all the evasive
twistings of little human schemes.  With this comfortable
casting of his burden upon fate Herrick went to sleep and
did not waken till he felt his chair settle on the pavement
of his own courtyard.
</p>

<p>
Promptly at five the next day Nasmith with his two
witnesses drove up the narrow hutung to Herrick's
star-studded gate.  His news had caused a great outcry at
home.  He had kept in confidence the story of Herrick's
offer of betrothal and how the father had threatened to
marry his daughter to a Chinese.  No hint had been
suggested to break the shock of this grievous information.
So stunned were his sister and nieces by an arrangement
which seemed both wanton and abominable that Nasmith,
to his own bitter amusement, found himself defending the
father, trying to convince his outraged relations that there
was nothing unnatural in betrothing to a Chinese a girl who
had been trained, all her life, to Chinese manners, Chinese
ways of life.  He was a lame advocate and could only listen,
with a disheartened smile, to the dozen wild plots for
saving Nancy which were bandied round the table.
</p>

<p>
"If she ever has a mind to it, she will save herself," was
the best comfort he could offer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the way Chinese women save themselves?"
asked his brother-in-law grimly.  "At the bottom of
a well."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith cheerfully would have strangled Mr. Ferris
for this ill-chosen remark.
</p>

<p>
At five the next day Herrick received his three guests.
They went curiously through the draughty hallways, the
wintry courtyards, to the room their host had prepared for
them.
</p>

<p>
"Here is the document," he said, offering them a piece
of carefully inscribed foolscap.  "Will you read it?  I think
it is properly phrased.  I spent twenty years in the Customs,
you know, and did my turn at writing dispatches."
</p>

<p>
The three men scanned the paper and could pick no flaw
in its wording.  Nasmith did begin to protest that he wanted
no executor's fee, but Herrick overruled him.  After
repeated scrutiny Ferris and Beresford signed their names
as witnesses.  Even Beresford's lips failed of their
customary joke at the solemn moment when Herrick handed
to his executor the will, which seemed the last seal on
a life that had failed.  Nasmith took it with trembling
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my friends, to be more cheerful," said Herrick,
"we must celebrate the occasion with a feast."
</p>

<p>
The banquet, it seemed, was ready.  In a neighboring
room the surprised men found the table spread with a
cotton cloth and crowded with the tidbits which precede
the meal: oranges, quarters of pomegranate, sections of
pomelo, ducks' eggs, black from their pickling in lime, the
thinnest slices of ham and sausage, dried melon seeds,
candied peanuts&mdash;a dozen dishes grouped in a pattern.
</p>

<p>
Despite the festive appearance of the board, the
grotesque decorations,&mdash;gay phœnixes ingeniously put
together from scented orchids, silk, and brass wire,&mdash;Herrick
surveyed the sight glumly.
</p>

<p>
"Four is poor company for a feast," he said, "but the
ladies will help to cheer us up."
</p>

<p>
"The ladies?" Nasmith wondered, with great hope in his
breast, and kept an ever expectant eye upon the door,
through which he longed every moment to see Nancy enter.
But the "ladies" were not of the household.  Never would
Herrick have violated Chinese custom so grossly as to
bring women of his own family to eat with strangers.  They
were sing-song girls, merry entertainers introduced after
the great dish, the sharks' fins, had been steamingly served.
Slim, lithe children in gaudy satin jackets, scant trousers,
they came in laughing, and sat in pretended embarrassment
on stools behind the four men.  Thimble-cups of heady
kao-liang soon put them at ease amid these Western
barbarians, roused their throats to shrill rhythmical songs
which Nasmith, in his disappointment, was slow to
appreciate, though the succession of explosive vowels and
sharply punctuated trills often gave scope for tones of
great tenderness.  Herrick was instantly at home with
these girls, patted them on the knees, teased them by bouts
of drinking games into consuming more wine.  Beresford
followed his example and waxed merry with the slender
damsel assigned for his delight, but Ferris, conscious of a
wife at home and of her brother present, was more discreet,
while Nasmith sat in morose silence, angry at these trivial
philanderings when his heart was aching for Nancy.
</p>

<p>
Yet even his anger melted as he began very slowly to
recognize that Herrick's gayety was feigned, that the man
was bidding an empty defiance to the shadow of death, the
shadow of defeat, which hung over him.  From the moment
Nasmith realized this the scene became almost too
ghastly to be endured.  The sight of this aging man, with
no recourse but a painted courtesan to keep up his spirits,
became the most pathetic display he had ever watched.  He
felt he was helpless in the presence of sorcery, helpless to
raise his fist and shatter the web of illusion.
</p>

<p>
Dish followed dish, all the variegated delicacies of a
Chinese meal, giblets fried and peppered, whole ducks
torn apart from their tongues to their feet, fish spicily
sandwiched in cabbage, steamed bread flavored with garlic
and pork, glutinous sweet rice into which lotus seeds and
candied fruit had been mixed&mdash;course after course, till
they had long become uncounted, before wine was poured
under a copper vessel and the flames allowed to lick its
sides with tongues of livid blue and green light and the
boiling water crowded with slices of raw fish and pheasant
and chicken, green vegetables and crusts of burnt rice, the
last splendid dish of the feast.  Herrick pushed these
ingredients into the cauldron with his chopsticks and then
heaped up the bowls of rice which had been served to his
guests, bidding them eat when they had no longer
appetite to eat.
</p>

<p>
Then he rose unsteadily.  He had consumed tens of the
tiny cupfuls of wine; his face was flushed.  But it was more
than the wine which seemed to overcome him at this
portentous moment.  A look in his eyes bade even the laughing
sing-song girls be quiet.  With the glare of the electric
lights beating upon his forehead he looked like a man lost,
utterly spent by the violence of a tropical sun.  He lifted
a glass with one shaking hand, leaned against the table
with the other.  His guests wondered dumbly what amazing
action was to follow.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said, "my heart is at rest."
</p>

<p>
"What a lie!" thought Nasmith.
</p>

<p>
"For a long time I have made myself miserable with
half measures.  That is finished, I tell you&mdash;finished,
finished.  To-night for the last time you have heard me speak
my native tongue.  I will never speak it again.  I want you
to drink to Timothy Herrick.  He is dead, thank God!  He
has no successors.  All that remains of him is that piece
of paper you have folded into your pocket."
</p>

<p>
Higher went his glass.  "To Timothy Herrick!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Surely he is mad," said the eyes of the men who were
watching him.
</p>

<p>
"To Timothy Herrick.  He was an unhappy man.  The
sooner he is forgotten, the better.  God rest his spirit!"
</p>

<p>
He drained the glass and then with an emphatic gesture
hurled it to the floor.  Instantly the four sing-song girls
followed his lead.  Highly amused by this noisy whimsical
end to the banquet, they "dried" their cups&mdash;as the
expression went&mdash;and hurled them down with a crash, so
that the splinters skipped like diamonds across the stone
floor.  Beresford, too, carried away by the tense feeling
of the moment, drank the ominous toast and shivered his
glass into fragments, making a crash which stirred the girls
into much laughter, much cheering and clapping of hands.
Only Ferris and Nasmith took no part in the riotous
demonstration: the one pulled his moustache in embarrassment
over such an unmanly display of emotion, the other looked
at Herrick as though he had beheld his words literally
fulfilled, as though he were gazing upon a corpse.
</p>

<p>
Not because of Herrick alone did his heart seem suffocated
with pain.  He was like a man staring into a crystal.
Behind the vow of lips that never again should speak
English he suffered a vision of Nancy shut off from sight and
sound, shut off from the timeless beauty of love.  In the
shattered fragments of glass, sparkling even in the
brilliance of this garish room, he saw all that she had been
born to enjoy flung away, wantonly destroyed.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p>
In a household where every trivial accident was snatched
at by the jaded inmates as meat for hours of excited gossip,
an event so unparalleled as the visit of three foreigners
was bound to stir Herrick's cloistered family to throbbing
ecstasies of curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Herrick in his own time gave away the secret.  He
called the t'ai-t'ai and told her the terms of his will.  There
was a glint of malice in his eyes when he saw that her
imperturbable countenance, well controlled though it usually
was, could not hide consternation at this unwelcome news.
He took pleasure in extolling the fairness of his scheme,
in hauling out one by one, like a magician extracting
rabbits from a hat, the advantages of a plan in which he knew
too well and too keenly the dazed woman could see no
shadow of advantage.
</p>

<p>
When she had been given the precedence of her station,
a full twenty-four hours to meditate upon the abominable
Western rectitude of this will, the British justice which
was the last outlandish gesture of the Timothy Herrick
who had ceased to be, he called up the other wives in turn
and told them what their share was to be and, in great
detail, how they were to get it.
</p>

<p>
None, of course, was satisfied, none but was sure this
unknown executor would rifle the estate with amiable
peculations of his own,&mdash;why shouldn't he?&mdash;yet the
three subordinate wives who filled the gap between the
t'ai-t'ai and Kuei-lien had less cause to grumble, because
they knew their shares were safer in the hands of a
stranger than left to the charity of the t'ai-t'ai.  This worthy
woman gaped for words to vent her disgruntled spleen.
</p>

<p>
"The older he grows, the madder he gets," she told
Kuei-lien.  "Who would have thought, after all these years,
after the careful management I have exercised in his
house, that he would turn from me, his wife, and put this
extravagant trust in a stranger?  It's these beastly children
he's concerned for; they disturb his mind and put these
queer notions into his head."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we're no worse off than we were before," said
Kuei-lien.  "I can still get money from him in the old
way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If his daughter doesn't interfere."
</p>

<p>
"We must see that she doesn't interfere."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai accepted this advice with a snort.  But there
was food for thought in the words.  She must take pains
to see that Nancy did not enjoy the liberty she had enjoyed
all too freely in the past.
</p>

<p>
"You do your part and I'll do mine," she said finally.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien was called upon soon for hers.  Herrick, sitting
dejectedly in his room, felt himself at the loose ends
of patience with life.  The future was settled.  He could
enjoy his desires without constraint.  He sent for his
concubine.  He was fingering his check book when she entered.
</p>

<p>
"You have been very clever," he said, "far more clever
than these other women of my household, I see.  My affection,
I notice, has paid you well in the last few months."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien smiled, not troubling to deny the greed he had
uncovered.
</p>

<p>
"Cleverness is always costly," she remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are right, it should be."
</p>

<p>
The man wrote a check larger than any of his previous
rewards; he read the sum before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It is unsigned, you observe," he explained.  "Now show
me if you are clever enough to win my signature to this
piece of paper."
</p>

<p>
This was temptation the concubine relished.  She led the
man through every extreme of her sensual imagination,
but even when beguiled into amorous confusion by her
beauty she found him obstinate in paying the price of her
victory, as though he had locked the gate to his treasure,
locked the gate and discarded the key.  Kuei-lien fell back
upon the last resource of her trade.  She provoked him to
cruelty.  She stood the sting of the lash across her naked
shoulders, smiling grimly, biting her lips to keep from
crying out in pain, quivering but not shrinking from each
fresh agony of his fury, till the time came when he fell,
sobbing like a baby, on his couch, exhausted in spirit,
ashamed of the mordant brutality which would have been
accounted vile from a beast.  It was easy, in his repentant
mood, to secure the signature of the check.
</p>

<p>
While the ordeal was livid in her memory, the girl bargained
her stripes against the cupidity of the t'ai-t'ai,
refusing downright to face more of this abuse till she had
got her share of the gains greatly increased.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai needed to keep her husband occupied, since
she was trying, for the first time in years, to win some
control over Nancy.  In the interests of her own family,
the family to which the girl was betrothed, she had specious
excuses of duty for overseeing the occupations of the girl.
She dismissed Nancy's teacher; what time was there, she
asked, for further frivolities of study in a girl who had
learned already too much for her own and her husband's
good?  To her surprise, Nancy submitted without complaint,
submitted so gracefully that the t'ai-t'ai suspected
some darkly cherished plot and went further in her
exactions, shortening the hours of Nancy's play in the garden,
setting her heavy tasks of sewing upon her bridal garments.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was unbelievably docile.  She was not reconciled
to the t'ai-t'ai's show of authority, which came with a bad
grace after the many years she had been left to go her own
willful path.  But the t'ai-t'ai for the moment was too
powerful and she was doing, after all, only what Nancy
recognized she had a right to do, making the girl a meet
and seemly wife for her nephew.  The marriage lurked
inescapably in front of her; Nancy had neither thought nor
plan of evading her engagement.  It was no use making
enemies of the family to which she must go, the family to
which the t'ai-t'ai, though she had left it, still seemed more
closely related than to Herrick's improvised house.  Meekly
Nancy bent her face over the scarlet satin of her bridal
gown and meditated all the gloomy, curious, fearful,
teasing thoughts which the mere color of the garments stirred
in her virgin mind.
</p>

<p>
Her old nurse was not so complaisant.  Her grumbles
lost their discreetness; their echoes were heard throughout
the house.  Kuei-lien warned her mistress.
</p>

<p>
"That's the old jade from whom Nancy gets her mischievous
ideas," she remarked.  "She did her best to break
up the engagement to your nephew."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you and she did your best, don't you?"
sniffed the woman.  "Still, you are right; the children have
grown up.  Why should they need a nurse?"
</p>

<p>
This was not a new thought.  But now the desperation
of the t'ai-t'ai heaped fuel upon her courage.  With
Herrick growing day by day more helpless in the arms of his
concubine, more childish, more easily and pitifully led like
a bear with a ring through his snout, the woman believed
the time at last had come for settling old scores and
writing off her balance of revenge.
</p>

<p>
The chance came when the cold winds blew for weeks
and filtering dust of spring, sweeping in clouds from the
plains of Kansu and the crumbling deserts of Gobi, choked
the house, suffocated ears and eyes and nostrils and throats
with fine sand, and reduced everyone's temper to that
inflammable point where quarrels leap up from a spark.
Nancy did fumbling work on her bridal skirt.  The t'ai-t'ai
rebuked her with harsh words.  The child threw aside
deference to her stepmother and responded as angrily.  But
her flare of indignation paled before the great blaze of
wrath which suddenly burst from the lips of the amah, who
had interposed in the dispute and been unable to quench
her long-stifled embers of hatred.
</p>

<p>
For all the pent-up enmity of the past she now found
words and, with no care who should hear her, she
denounced Nancy's tyrant with long sentences of withering
invective.  The whole household rushed to hear; the other
wives stood round with gaping mouths, secretly gloating
over the t'ai-t'ai's discomfiture.  Even Herrick could not
remain deaf to such noise and was forced irritably to inquire
the reason for this disturbance.  In her frenzy the nurse was
like a poetess, singing out her unforgivable abuse in a
rhythmical chant which her victim was powerless to quell.
Every line was jerked short with a taunt, as though the
infuriated woman defied the world to contradict her words.
The taunts stung like little leaden pellets on the end of a
whiplash.  Nancy, standing cold and white in dismay,
expected to see these venomous syllables cut marks of blood
across the face of her stepmother.
</p>

<p>
A scene like this could not be excused.  The result was
what the old nurse had foreseen and tried with such
patience to guard against during every provocation of the
last few months: she was called before Herrick, his wife
standing vindictively at his side, and told the cruel, farcical
pretexts proper to the decencies of the occasion.  The
children had outgrown a nurse.  She deserved a rest after
these many years of faithful service, service Herrick was
glad to reward with a gift which would keep her in comfort
to the end of her years.  The man knew in his heart he
was pronouncing a dastardly sentence.  His voice faltered
when he referred to the better reward the old woman
would find in the hearts of his children.  But it was a just
sentence.  He would not be moved when the amah threw
herself at his feet and begged with tears to remain.  The
demonstrative scene vexed him.  He hated scenes.  The more
the stricken woman pleaded, the more stubbornly his will
hardened.  He turned away and left her weeping uselessly.
</p>

<p>
Yet, terrible as her grief had been, not till Nancy and
Edward learned her punishment did it reach its climax.
The two children heard the news as though the world
had crumbled round them.  They were losing the only
mother they knew, for there had been not a day of their
lives but began and ended with the cheerful gossip of their
nurse.  Edward was dazed by a whimpering unbelief, while
Nancy went to intercede with her father.  But he was
tired of the subject, conscious that he had been less than
fair, so he curtly told her to mind her own affairs and for
the last time to stop interfering with the counsels of her
elders.
</p>

<p>
In her despair the wretched girl sought the t'ai-t'ai,
from whom she could not remember having ever asked
sympathy or help.  She was too proud to beg or to weep;
this was not her way.
</p>

<p>
"It was my fault, not amah's," she said.  "Won't you
punish me?  I provoked the trouble.  I was undutiful,
hot-headed.  I deserve to be punished, not an old woman who
has been a servant so long that she has forgotten her place.
She will never do this again, I can promise you."
</p>

<p>
"I am not punishing anyone," said the t'ai-t'ai with
her blandest accents.  "The quarrel&mdash;pooh, I've forgotten
that.  We all lose our tempers at times.  I'm not punishing
your amah.  Why should I wish to punish an old and
loyal servant?  This is your father's decision, a decision
he made long ago.  How can you call it a punishment to
reward a faithful servant by letting her spend the rest of
her life in peace and quiet?  Is there any one of us who
wouldn't rejoice at such punishment?"
</p>

<p>
"But if she doesn't want peace and quiet, why force
these blessings upon her?"
</p>

<p>
"She may not desire peace and quiet; we do," replied
the t'ai-t'ai unwarily.
</p>

<p>
"Then it is a punishment."
</p>

<p>
The woman was vexed by Nancy's persistence.
</p>

<p>
"You are too young to concern yourself with things
you don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"But I do understand this," Nancy insisted; "you are
punishing her because she does not wish to go.  You are
punishing her for my fault.  I want to be punished."
</p>

<p>
"You want to be punished, do you?  And what do you
consider a suitable punishment?  Would you go and tell
your father you wish to be married this year, not to wait
three more years?  Would you do this so that your stupid
old amah can wear out her bones working when she
might be at home, growing fat in ease and idleness?"
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai phrased her proposal in terms of contemptuous
absurdity, as though to say she had no hope of its
being accepted.  She watched the girl narrowly, enjoying
the look of dismay which crossed her face and more than
a little surprised that Nancy should take the offer
seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Is this a punishment?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"You mean do I consider marriage to my nephew a
punishment?" said the stepmother, for once talking openly
to Nancy as she never would have talked to one of her
own race.  "Would I have made the match if I thought
of it so?  I am not used to these newfangled manners.
When I was married, my mother didn't speak of it to
me or ask me what I wished.  Her wisdom was enough.
But your father has new ideas, perhaps they are foreign
ideas, and so we promised you should have these four
years at home because he thought you wanted them.  So
there we are, bound by a promise.  And my mother is
growing old and feeble; she wants to see her grandson
married; she keeps reproaching my brother for his
promise, saying she cannot live another three years, she
cannot wait so long.  What am I to do?  If you told your
father you were ready to be married, he might release
us from this promise.  Then there would be happiness
for all of us."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai grew embarrassed by the unexpected
lengths of her recital and was not her usual cool self.
The unlooked-for event of Nancy's even seeming to
hesitate over this proposal had shaken the woman out
of her suavity.  Nancy too might have been confused by
hearing her marriage and even her future husband so
freely mentioned by that most correct of all persons, the
t'ai-t'ai, but this breach of impropriety dwindled to
inconsequence beside the choice she felt bound to make.
</p>

<p>
"If I tell my father this, will the amah remain?"
</p>

<p>
"I will see that she does remain.  I promise you that,
although it will not be easy, now that your father has
decided she shall go."
</p>

<p>
"And suppose I tell my father this, what does it mean?
Does it mean that I must be married this year, that I
cannot wait three more, even two more, years?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't answer for what it may mean to your father.
You know his mind as well as I do.  It may mean nothing
to him.  He makes his own laws.  He may choose to wait,
he may choose to hasten your wedding, he may choose
anything.  How can I see into his brain?"
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai showed by a gesture that she had long ago
given up fathoming the vagaries of her husband's will.
</p>

<p>
Nancy pondered the matter.  More than deep affection
for the amah stirred her heart.  She was seized by an
unconscionable longing for sacrifice, a desire to do
something heroic, to end the tedious apathy of waiting and
fearing which had sapped her spirit in recent months.
The suspense and the slowly encroaching tyranny of her
stepmother were becoming unbearable.  She wanted courage
to drag out day after day of this dreary monotonous
life, knowing too well it was only a joyless postponement
of the sacrifice she must at last make.  Her books had been
taken away from her, her play, her English lessons, the
companionship of her father; now they were taking away
the nurse who had been like a mother.  What was life
worth under these conditions?  What happiness did her
respite of four years promise?  How could the misery of
the future be worse than the misery of the present?
</p>

<p>
Nancy, like most children, could not appreciate the
immense distance of years which still lay ahead, time enough
to make the sorrows of her teens seem slight reason for
tears.  Her sadness of the moment loomed eternal.  The
girl was swept by a gust of despair when she thought of
her own plight and heard the frightening echoes of her
father's debasement, the father whose sordid state she
could only guess because every effort she made to be of
help only estranged him further.  She was in a mood to
be desperate.  If she did no good to herself, her consent,
however rash it might be, had at least this merit in the
good it was doing for the nurse she loved so well.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, glad to feel she was active again, "I
will do as you wish: I will tell my father, as soon as he
sends for me, that I wish to be married this year.  But
you must do your part of the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"You can depend upon me for that," answered the
t'ai-t'ai, taken aback, even after Nancy's long silence, by
this sudden pleasant sequel to a proposal offered wholly
at random.  She had never dreamed that Nancy would comply.
Truly, these foreigners were unsearchable.  Nancy's
one bitter satisfaction from the scene was in noting the
t'ai-t'ai's bewilderment, the t'ai-t'ai's sense of being
baffled, even in her moment of triumph, by the simplicity of
the girl who had promised on point-blank request what
she herself had been preparing months of subtle intrigue
to effect.
</p>

<p>
"You must prepare the way," Nancy added, "if you
want me to speak to my father.  I cannot go to him
outright and say I wish to be married.  I am not so
shameless as that."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't shameless for foreigners to discuss these
things," the t'ai-t'ai reassured her.  "Nothing is shameless
for foreigners."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a foreigner," Nancy answered sharply.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai was equal to the task.  Although she had
not expected Nancy's compliance, for weeks she had been
drumming into Herrick's ears, through Kuei-lien's
insinuating lips, the thought that Nancy ought to be wedded.
The father, at first, had listened humorously as though
he read the jest of Kuei-lien's envy.  But insistence had
forced the notion into his brain.  He began to argue it
with himself and then with his concubine.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I make my daughter unhappy for your
amusement?" he protested.
</p>

<p>
And now Kuei-lien was able to say, "It is her own wish."
</p>

<p>
"It is, is it?" scoffed the father.  "Very well, we shall
see."
</p>

<p>
He summoned his daughter.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," he said, "you know perhaps that when I
arranged your betrothal I did this on condition that you
should not be married till you were twenty.  I wanted
you to enjoy the last few years of your childhood in the
freedom your mother had.  And I did not choose to
deprive myself too soon of your companionship.  I haven't
had so much of your companionship as I looked for,
but&mdash;well, we won't go into that.  My illness has upset
matters.  But now Kuei-lien astonishes me by saying you don't
want this freedom, that you are tired of your father's
home and wish to be married.  Never mind the delicacy
or indelicacy of the question, but just tell me frankly, is
this true?"
</p>

<p>
"It is true," answered the girl, speaking quickly lest
time to think alter her reply.  She needed more than her
old amah's reprieve, so suddenly given, so unbelievingly
accepted, to hold her steady to the promise she had made;
she needed new symptoms of the willful spirit which
urged her to risk her life's happiness all on the prospect
of change.  The symptoms were not to be depended on;
they might fail.  She used them while they lasted, and
said, "It is true."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you wish to be married, you would rather
be married than to wait?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Seldom had Herrick imagined his heart torn as by this
terse reply.  He took it as a mark of Nancy's immense
ingratitude.  Had he not been vexing himself cruelly over
her future, picturing the sorrow, the loneliness and
homesickness which even the best-laid plans must bring to
pass, desperately trying to convince himself that he had
done only right in betrothing the child; and now she was
stretching out her hands for what seemed in her eyes to
be only a glittering toy.  He was saddened, disappointed.
He had never thought Nancy could be so fickle.  His vanity
was hurt.  He had never believed his daughter, the object
of long-drawn-out concern and anguish, could so quickly,
almost flippantly, resign the father who had loved her.
</p>

<p>
Her own self, as he remembered her from tender moments
of a summer gone by, cried out against the words
she had spoken.  She had wanted, so she once said, to
remain "like this forever&mdash;forever."  Now she denied
these words.  She had no feeling, no affection.  She was
shallow, inconstant, humbugged by one whim to-day, by
another gaudy whim to-morrow, no better than the tattling
women round her.  Well, it showed the folly of being
anxious about the sorrows of other people, even of one's
own children.  "I am at least rid of this worry," thought
the man in his anger.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please," he said coldly.  "If you wish to be
married, married you shall be&mdash;and soon."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<p>
Nancy now became the least important personage in the
household.  She was the centre, it was true, round which
the preparations of the t'ai-t'ai were grouped, but she
had discarded her personality when she surrendered this
last right to hold her destiny an arm's length away.  Now
she was merely the prop on which to hang scarlet bridal
garments.  The old impersonal traditions of the past, which
weighted and stiffened all that had to do with so human
and pathetic an act as the sending a maiden out from the
home of her father, hung heavily from her slight shoulders.
The rite, promising so welcome a break into the
monotony of the women's quarters, filled every mind,
but there remained little thought or sympathy for the
girl who was the cause of it all.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai had given her husband no time to change
his mind.  She had sent the news at once to her brother,
urging upon him haste in choosing the festive date.  This
the family of the bridegroom were prompt to do.  They
called in the fortune-tellers once more and, with their
sage advice, settled upon a day, the twenty-fifth of the
eighth moon, soon after the autumn festival, a date
practical besides auspicious, because the bills for this
expensive event need not be met till the New Year.
</p>

<p>
Nancy heard the news quietly and regarded the
preparations going forward as though they belonged not to
herself but to another.  The amah, whom she had saved,
took her reprieve with stolid surprise.  She thanked the
t'ai-t'ai and said nothing more.  She seemed thoroughly
cowed by the narrowness of her escape and was more
discreet than she had ever been, taking care to leave Nancy
alone lest she appear to interfere with the cherished
schemes of the t'ai-t'ai.  Yet she did much thinking.  She
was not blind to the mystery of the change in her fortunes,
but quick enough to connect it with the openly mooted
rumor that Nancy herself, incredible though it was, had
asked to have the day of her wedding hastened.  She
thought and brooded, but there was no one to whom she
could appeal.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was silent.  Her father showed signs of renewed
illness; he grew haggard and lean, took no care for any
company except Kuei-lien's, abused her in spells of
morbid cruelty and then fell back, terrified and choking, a
prey to the attacks of heart disease which were recurring
more and more often.  The man had given up hope of
living much longer.
</p>

<p>
"I will enjoy myself while I last," he vowed.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien was both his passion and his doom.  He was
jealous of every moment she spent out of his sight.  He
planned, in his more evil moments, to kill his concubine
before he died so that she should not have the satisfaction
of practising upon others the wiles she had practised upon
him.  He hated her and adored her, and for hours satiated
his hunger for the receding beauty of life by the sight
of her clad in the most splendid garments he could
command, stiff golden brocades, satins dyed to match the
dissolving gray of the eastern sky at dawn, lustrous fabrics
surpassed by the cool skin of the girl, fabrics forgotten
when Herrick looked at the poignant loveliness of her
face, features of a candid delicacy on which the lust and
greed of the world seemed to have written no trace.  She
sang the old haunting songs of the farmer and the fisherman
and the scholar and the hermit in his mountains,
verse after verse, with an artlessness which was incomparable
art, the pathetic innocence of a child.  There were
times when Herrick's gloomy room was lit up by the
splendor of Kuei-lien's beauty, when the concubine herself,
great in the austere perfection of her presence, was
not great enough to vie with the golden illusion she created.
</p>

<p>
Often the pain of these supreme illusions drove the
man into frenzy; at other times it quieted his heart, as
though there were nothing more to be satisfied with in
life.  His spirit grew numb.  Caught by Kuei-lien's
enchantment, he nodded his head, fell drowsily asleep,
thinking what bliss it would be never to wake, but to stay
lulled through eternity by the vision he had seen.  Yet
he always woke, and always from disturbed dreams in
which Nancy unaccountably had taken the place of Kuei-lien
and reproached him with a slow smile on her lips.
She kept jerking him back to life, jerking him back when
all his senses were slow and his eyes ready for sleep.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no peace till she is married," he said,
"and I wonder if I shall have peace then."
</p>

<p>
On the impulse of a moment he decided to atone to
his children for the neglect of a year.  They should have
one more summer in the hills.
</p>

<p>
"She shall have one more happy summer and be free
as the wind," he said.
</p>

<p>
Against the violent protests of the t'ai-t'ai, he stuck to
his plan, but as a sop to his wife he added Li-an to the
party, and off to the Western Hills he went.  Kuei-lien,
Nancy, Edward, the amah, they all went along, rubbing
their eyes to see the willows still hanging low over the
ditches, the two camels grazing where they grazed twelve
months ago,&mdash;they seemed hardly to have moved in the
seasons which had intervened,&mdash;and to gaze, with the
rapture bred of imprisonment within walls, upon the vast,
gentle color of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
While their chairs toiled over the hills, Kuei-lien sang
fragments of old songs; her voice was tender as the
evening light.  Much though the bitterness which had
grown between them, Nancy could not help loving the
other girl in this hour of sunset because there came forth
from her tones that sadness of the human lot which was
common to them both.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The falling sun glows upon crumpled mountains,<br>
  Making every ridge gold, every deep valley amethyst;<br>
  The bamboos fling plumed heads like spray at the foot of the cliffs;<br>
  Vainly their waves sweep round the crimson walls of the temple;<br>
  Up the slope winds the path;<br>
  Peasants, balancing great loads, sing as they climb.<br>
  Ah, their songs are all of heaviness and burdens."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Nancy looked with pondering eyes upon the wild upper
meadows; illuminated they seemed, not only by the sun
but by the words of the song which went so close to their
heart.  With redoubled intensity came the longing to sink
her spirit in these tranquil scenes, to make them her home
where she might dwell with the flowers she had worshiped.
Tears swept like rain across her face; she bowed her head
and wept.  There was no cure for the unhappiness she
felt.  She had plucked the flowers and tossed them aside;
so men would deal with her.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Being scoffed at as a fool, I bury the flowers,<br>
  Yet know not who in other times will bury me;<br>
  In a morning the spring is finished, the crimson colors are old;<br>
  Flowers fall, men perish; both are known no more."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
So she quoted the words of Tai-yü and dreamed that she
too shared the fate of that pitiful heroine whom life had
dowered with too burning a capacity for passion, too
great and destroying joy in beauty.
</p>

<p>
This was not the way Herrick meant his daughter to
begin her last free summer.  The next morning, early, he
sent for her, and in the room Nancy remembered so well,
with the sun pouring blithely through the window, the
rustle of trees, the noise of the brook at full traffic, sounds
carried crisply on the air of a young vigorous day, amid
these things which belonged more intimately to the room
than its furniture, the father explained how careless of
trouble he wished his daughter to be.
</p>

<p>
"This is our last summer together," he said, "and I
have planned this summer for you.  Perhaps I have been
harsh at times, and not always fair; it is difficult to be
fair when one is ill.  I truly do not wish to lose you, Nancy,
but&mdash;well, you know how things have happened.  Nothing
can happen but what the gods allow.  We can't question
fate.  So let's enjoy ourselves as though no shadow hung
over us.  I want you to crowd a lifetime of happiness into
these months, for it's no use disguising from you, my
child, that you will have burdens in the future; happy
though you may be, you will have burdens.  I've scandalized
your stepmother by bringing you here: she thinks
you ought to be sitting at home sewing.  But I don't want
my daughter to spend her last months of childhood as a
seamstress.  This is your summer, Nancy, you are to be
free as you wish.  No one is to hinder you.  I make no
rules, impose no conditions.  I only ask you to be happy,
be the child that you ought to be at your time of life,
and not give a moment's worry to what must come afterward."
</p>

<p>
He gave the silent girl a glance of affection which
seemed to have taken twenty years from his age.  The
thinness which had come upon him of late enabled one to guess
how fine his features once must have been.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Nancy," he said softly, "don't stay so solemn.
Can't you give your father just one smile?"
</p>

<p>
In response to his begging Nancy's face lightened.  Her
eyes displayed such a look of perfect confidence that the
father felt himself privileged never to forget what he
had seen, for he had seen the mother herself given back to
him for a brief moment from the region of shadows.  The
look spoke thoughts deeper than anything the girl knew
or could frame in words: it spoke of a trust, an
understanding, which would live between father and daughter,
no matter what sorrows, no matter if death itself
interposed.  Separation would come, but never could they be
truly separated.  This was the loyalty Nancy offered.  It
was not entirely a smile; it had too much of the unearthly
radiance of clouds which flame at dawn before a tempest;
but it satisfied her father and filled his heart.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<p>
The days in the Western Hills were always to be associated
with the singing of birds.  In the first hours of the
morning they began their blithe chattering; the maples
and locusts rang with their notes, notes of many modes
from the raucous shriek of the jay, the screech of the
oriole, as he plunged recklessly like a yellow meteor into
the leafy branches, through a gamut of whistling and
twittering, of doves cooing and cuckoos never tiring of
their two-syllabled speech, to the liquid trills of the myna,
whose efforts were a challenge for the birds of the temple
to emulate.
</p>

<p>
It was time for Edward and Li-an to tumble joyfully
through the dewy grass and for Nancy to follow them
when once the canaries were awake in their bamboo cages,
swelling their throats to tell the animation of clear sunshine
while the starlings with their split tongues discoursed
the news of the day.
</p>

<p>
Nancy could not go wholly back to the past.  Li-an was
a more congenial playmate for Edward.  The mountains
were so new to her that she was willing to believe all the
elaborate mysteries the boy invented and to do her part
manfully in digging for treasure.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere of the household was one of calm.
Even Kuei-lien seemed to have no ends of her own to
pursue and kept her master's affections in a tranquil key
as though she herself wished some holidays after the hectic
winter she had spent.  The settlement of Nancy's fortunes
gave every appearance of having wiped off the score
between the two girls so that a friendliness of the old sort
thrived; many a hot afternoon they spent together in
comfortable abandon, content to discuss only those topics they
could treat gayly.
</p>

<p>
Nancy made the most of her father's license and seldom
was there favorable weather that she did not climb by
narrow paths to the top of the ridge where she could fancy
the whole wide world at her feet.  She did not guess,
though her instinct must have taken knowledge, that she
might meet the friend who held his dark corner in her
memory.  Nasmith was not likely to return to the Western
Hills without some effort to see whether Herrick's strange
family were occupying their temple.  He upbraided himself
for folly, but it became more and more his habit to
excuse himself from Beresford's too cheerful company and
to lurk in the outskirts of the house where he had
declined his chance with such justifiable weakness the year
before.  He tried to condone his curiosity on grounds of
plausible interest, yet he felt always too much the spy to
knock openly at the door, so that days passed before he
knew the Herricks really had returned.  This news he did
not even dare tell his family, but he hovered like a
discontented spirit on the hills above, straining his eyes for
impossible glimpses of Nancy, and then, one afternoon,
as he was bound to do, came upon her sitting in a pocket
of rock high above the ravine.  She did not hear him
approach.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Nancy," he said, "it is a long, long
time since the happy day when we met.  You don't go
roving any more to temples."
</p>

<p>
The girl gave him a startled glance.  A look of momentary
fear gleamed in her eyes.  Gladness came next, and
then misery.  The wind had blown her hair in disarray over
her forehead till it was like a veil behind which her
thoughts seemed to hide.  Nasmith longed to draw them
out from their covert, to see whether they were happy
thoughts, whether they dwelt with contentment on the
betrothal by which they were bound.  There was an instant
when his senses laughed at control, when he felt it
his duty and his right to carry off this girl in defiance of
all pledged engagements; and had he realized what Nancy
herself did not realize, that she sat there with the implicit
hope of meeting him, he might for once have acted upon
his senses; but she seemed so unapproachable, so cool, in
the alien shape of her garments, the white grass-linen
which clad her slender body, that the thought of loving
her from nearer than a distance became sacrilege.
</p>

<p>
"I only come here," said Nancy, and smiled a little;
"I don't go to temples any more."
</p>

<p>
"And you don't play cricket any more, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I never learned cricket."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you do?" Nasmith inquired.  "How
do you pass the time?"
</p>

<p>
"I come here to read&mdash;Edward is noisy sometimes&mdash;and
I like to see the mountains."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you ever come to see us again?  My nieces ask
about you and talk about you day after day."
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't do that now.  My father would not like it."
</p>

<p>
"But he was very friendly last year and this spring he
asked me to do some important business for him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I am not so free as last year."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy found this question hard to meet even in English;
in Chinese she never would have dreamed of answering.
But foreigners, she had understood, discussed these
things without reticence.
</p>

<p>
"My father has promised me to be engaged, to be
married."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but that is four&mdash;or is it three&mdash;years away."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am to be married soon&mdash;in two months."
</p>

<p>
Nasmith looked at her in dazed unbelief.
</p>

<p>
"Your father said you were not to be married till you
were twenty."
</p>

<p>
"I changed that&mdash;I asked to be married earlier."
</p>

<p>
Nancy went on quite naturally from one confession to
the next, talking frankly on the banned subject as though
thirteen years of Chinese life had not forbidden fear.  She
liked the thrill of breaking such unwelcome news to the
friend she trusted so oddly.
</p>

<p>
"You changed it!  Do you like the thought of this marriage?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;I was tired of the house, tired of the
women, tired of sewing."
</p>

<p>
"And do you think that there won't be a house and
women and sewing after you are married?"
</p>

<p>
"They will be different."
</p>

<p>
It was pleasing to meet someone who thought of her
part in the bargain that had been made.
</p>

<p>
"Different!" exclaimed Nasmith.  "Ah, Nancy, it will
be worse drudgery than anything you have known.  You
speak like a child.  You don't know what you are saying.
Do you think marriage is play?"
</p>

<p>
"I have to be married.  My father said so."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what your father did?" said the man,
emboldened by his pity.  "Do you know that your father
offered to marry you to me?"
</p>

<p>
This was a question the girl was wholly unready to
face.  The swift progress of their conversation had carried
her too far.
</p>

<p>
"And I refused," said Nasmith, determined to have
it out, "I refused because he asked impossible terms.  He
wanted to keep you till you were twenty, would not let
you go to school as I asked, would not let you be brought
up with my nieces.  I was a fool.  I should have kept my
claim upon you.  You are not Chinese, Nancy, you have
no right to be Chinese.  And now you are to be thrown
away because of my obstinacy and your father's
blindness."
</p>

<p>
"You are not my father," said the girl indignantly;
"he is not blind.  I am Chinese.  I am Chinese&mdash;I must
go home.  I talk too much."
</p>

<p>
She stood up.  Anger and despair fought in her brain.
She felt helpless before Nasmith's outspoken manners, a
prey to her stupid frankness in encouraging him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," begged the man.  "I suppose you think I
am rude, but I had to speak out my mind.  It is our Western
way, you know.  I keep forgetting you are not used to
it.  I can't keep quiet when I see anything as wicked as this
marriage to which you are being sacrificed.  If I went to
your father to-day, don't you think he would hear me?
If I told him to have his own way, to keep you where
he pleased till you are twenty, couldn't we break this
engagement?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't break engagements," the girl answered
proudly.  She turned cool, almost cold in her firmness, now
that Nasmith had been betrayed into what she felt was
a dishonorable weakness.  "My father doesn't change and
I don't change.  We have promised."
</p>

<p>
"Fiddlesticks!  Engagement is not marriage.  It was
your father's first wish, remember, that I should marry
you."
</p>

<p>
"My father has told me his wish.  I am engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Can you read this?" persisted the man, drawing from
his pocketbook a copy of the scrolls Herrick had written.
"This is what your father wrote.  Can you read it?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked at the paper curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Did my father write this for you?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he wrote it for me last year, the day when we
brought you home from my sister's house.  He told me
these characters had a meaning for me if I could
understand them."
</p>

<p>
"They have a meaning," the girl admitted.
</p>

<p>
"What meaning?"
</p>

<p>
"You are the sun," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course; but who is the moon?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I was the moon&mdash;then&mdash;last year."
</p>

<p>
"You are still the moon," he declared.  "They were
not written merely for last year."
</p>

<p>
Nancy did not answer him.  The copied characters of
the scroll had been like a glimpse into her father's mind.
She had played so long with these riddles as to be
profoundly moved by what she saw so clearly her father had
meant to be prophecy.  Great was her reverence for the
written word.  She was like the Chinese who will not allow
even a scrap of printed paper to be trodden underfoot,
like the governor who forbade newspapers to be used for
wrapping parcels because this was treating characters
shamefully, showing despite to the very means of the
culture which sages and poets had labored to create.  For
scrolls her deference was superstitious.  They were oracles,
working out their own mystical fulfillment.  Versed as she
was in their subtlety, in their history, in the earth-shaking
powers of a single well-written character, the byplay of
allusion which had torn down dynasties or raised men to
favor with the Son of Heaven, she looked with fear and
bewilderment upon her father's message as though she
were reading a mandate of the gods, for the scroll
expressed her father's belief and his wish that she should
be the wife of this stranger from the West.
</p>

<p>
"I am engaged," she repeated as though she were defying
heaven.  "We have promised!"
</p>

<p>
Nasmith saw this could not be argued further.  More
words only would make the girl stubborn, perhaps lose
him the chance of seeing her again.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, we won't debate the matter," he said, "but
do you think your father would let you come to stay for
a few days with my sister&mdash;and your brother, of course?
My nieces will never be satisfied to miss seeing you; if
they heard I had met you, they would send me back for
you.  And this is not the request of a stranger, you know.
After all, I am almost a guardian.  You will come, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was in a contrary mood.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" echoed Nasmith impatiently.  "Why?  I should
not have thought you needed to ask that question.  Does
not your memory suggest reasons enough?  After all,
Nancy, you won't find friends so plentiful in this world
that you can afford to neglect those you have."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Edward can come," she admitted, "but if I
can come&mdash;I don't know.  It is different for me because
I am engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Will you ask your father?" Nasmith persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will ask him," said Nancy; and away she went
swiftly, like the quiet, swift descent of evening.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith did not try to follow, although it was high
time for him to be swinging into his sturdy stride
homeward.  He felt as much amazed by the riddles as Nancy
herself.  Suddenly it occurred to him that this was only
his second meeting with the girl&mdash;two meetings, and
these a year apart.  He could not account for the intense
feeling which made him still loiter in this spot as though
all that was real of her were lingering with him.  He could
not understand the attraction which held him.  Was
there real insight, after all, expressed in those words
whose meaning with baffling enlightenment he now realized?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sun moving to the west kindles a splendid beacon for the moon;<br>
  The moon following from the east tenderly displays the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflection of the sun.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Or had these words, slowly maturing in his mind, worked
their own desire for fulfillment?  He loved these
mountains the sun had painted in broad sweeping colors, to
which night was hurrying to put in shadow.  He regarded
them tenderly; they seemed to breathe of Nancy, to sing
of Nancy, with the old time-worn cadence of the land
whose tongue she had learned.  Ah, what a beacon he could
light for her, what a splendid beacon he must set blazing!
She could not, she should not, be lost to him!
</p>

<p>
So the serene glow of evening had helped him find
himself, had made him resolute, had sent him home
resolute, after a year of fighting shadows.
</p>

<p>
Nancy, in her own way, was tranquil.  The habit of
taking life as it came enabled her to speak simply to her
father about this meeting with Nasmith and about his
request.  The father was still indulgent.  He did not need
to remind himself of his promise; this was Nancy's summer.
He had screwed his will to its final pitch when he
consented to the date of her marriage.  Nothing more
seemed to matter; nothing more was he willing to
debate.  Let life run as it chose.
</p>

<p>
"I see no harm in it," he said, dealing with Nasmith's
invitation.  "Mr. Nasmith is a man I trust and his family,
so far as I met them, are delightful.  The change will be
good for you both.  I will send a man the first thing
in the morning to tell them you are coming, and by
the afternoon the chairs can be ready for you to start.
Amah of course must go.  They're sure to have room for
her."
</p>

<p>
In this matter-of-fact way Herrick granted the request
as though it were business of no concern.  Nancy was not
so sure.  She too could not rid her memory of the prophetic
lines her father had written.  The words had caught in
her brain.  She repeated them till she fell asleep and
repeated them again in the morning when her spirit had
become infected by Edward's growing excitement.  With
great ado the little procession set out, the amah waving
more farewells than a traveler bound across the ocean.
Nancy was not insensible of the bustle.  She was both
glad and afraid, timid and joyful, but she abandoned her
body to the motion of the chair, lying back with eyes half
closed, while the sun beat hot through the screened window.
She was content to let her spirit be carried, like her
limbs, with the inertia which leaves every directing
impulse to destiny.  "The sun&mdash;the moon; the moon&mdash;the
sun&mdash;t'ai-yang, yueh-liang; yueh-liang&mdash;t'ai-yang," the
words made their own drowsy refrain to the slogging
pace of the coolies.
</p>

<p>
Deep was the silence which had fallen over the deserted
household.  Herrick had not realized how much he would
miss these children whom never before had he allowed to
go away from their home.  The sun shone vacantly on
the temple; in the evening he walked with Kuei-lien in
the moonless dark, passing the tomb of the monk and
standing pensive on the little platform which overhung the
ravine.  He was like a lonely child, but afraid of something
worse than the loss of Nancy and Edward, afraid of the
solitariness of death, which seemed to threaten him from
the deep shadows of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien too felt the spell and did little to cheer him.
The song she sang was sad, the old tragic tale from The
Three Kingdoms of the first break in a brotherhood, which
had become classic, the brotherhood of the Peach Orchard,
wherein three heroes had stood gayly steadfast
to each other through years of war, only to be separated
by death at the last.  She sang the story Herrick knew so
well and loved for its sombre beauty: how Liu Pei, King
of Shu, had wakened from troubled sleep to see the ghost
of his blood-brother, Kuan Yü, not knowing it was a
ghost, not knowing he had been slain.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A cold gust of wind blew in his chamber; the lamp flickered
and became bright again.  Liu Pei looked up and saw a man
standing behind the lamp.
</p>

<p>
"What man are you that comes in the dead of night to
my chamber?"
</p>

<p>
The man did not answer.  Liu Pei, in alarm, got up to
look.  It was Kuan Yü who was hiding behind the shadow
of the lamp.
</p>

<p>
Liu Pei exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my brother, have you been well since we parted?
You must have great reason to come thus in the depth of
night.  You and I are the same bone and flesh; why do you
show this deference?"
</p>

<p>
Then Kuan Yü wept and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Brother, raise your armies and avenge me.  Wipe my
wrongs clean as snow."
</p>

<p>
He finished speaking.  A cold wind arose.  He had vanished.
Suddenly Liu Pei awoke; and it was a dream.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Kuei-lien's voice made the tragedy seem real to her
master&mdash;the terror of that awakening.  She told how at
the third watch Liu Pei sent for his minister, K'ung Ming,
whose strategy and knowledge of the stars and
unworldly faithfulness had won him this kingdom in the
west.  K'ung Ming tried to comfort him out of his fear,
but when he had left the presence of the King he met a
friend who told him that there were evil rumors abroad
about the fate of Kuan Yü.  Then K'ung Ming unburdened
his heart.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"To-night I have seen a sign in the heaven," he confessed.
"I saw a star fall over Chingchou and I know that Kuan Yü
has met with evil there.  But I am afraid of my master's grief
and dare not tell him."
</p>

<p>
Even while the two were speaking a man suddenly came
forth, caught hold of K'ung Ming's sleeve and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If there is evil news, why do you deceive me?"
</p>

<p>
K'ung Ming looked; it was Liu Pei.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you distress yourself over uncertain news?" he
said.  "Why let yourself be so unprofitably sad?"
</p>

<p>
Liu Pei answered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I and Kuan Yü have sworn to live and die together.  If
he has fallen, how can I stand alone?"
</p>

<p>
Then, one by one, disturbing the peace of the night, came
messengers.
</p>

<p>
"Kuan Yü is defeated."
</p>

<p>
"Kuan Yü is betrayed."
</p>

<p>
And, before it was light:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Kuan Yü is slain."
</p>

<p>
Liu Pei, when he heard it, gave one great cry and fell
fainting to the ground.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Herrick listened as though these things had not happened
centuries and centuries ago, as though the three
men still whispered beneath the flickering torches of the
palace.  He saw the King cast down by his mighty grief
to the cold stones of the pavement.  It was as if Kuei-lien
herself had sung away the Golden Age and its heroes.
He turned to the girl; her face was almost luminous in
the dark.  His heart was too burdened for speech.  She
had sung away his own Golden Age, sung away his
lustihood and strength.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you deceive me, ah, why do you deceive me,
Kuei-lien?" he asked sadly, echoing Liu Pei's words with
a meaning which the girl understood for a moment, but
never understood again.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<p>
Long before this Nancy was happily asleep.  Thoughts of
sun and moon had gone glimmering before the joy of her
welcome.  Helen and Elizabeth and their uncle had come
far along the road to meet the chairs of their guests and
out they pulled Nancy and Edward for a gay walk home.
It was so like their coming a year ago and so different,
the same dusky winding down the mountain path to the
settlement, the same bright lights and noise of music from
a score of summer homes, the glimpse of the verandah
through the trees with servants bustling to set knives and
forks on the table.  But Nancy came now without fear,
like one who had her own place in this merry family.  She
welcomed Mrs. Ferris's arms and Mrs. Ferris's kisses
and followed the chattering twins to the room she was to
share with them.
</p>

<p>
Not even dinner could frighten her, nor her place of
honor at Nasmith's right.  She caught sight of the amah's
face beaming through the door and infectious echoes of
her laughter over being once more, after all these years,
with people whose ways she understood.  The old servant
was holding forth princely gossip in the kitchen and the
same light-hearted key prevailed in the conversation of
the table, so that Nancy's eyes glowed and her lips broke
into more smiles than they had shown for months.  Hosts
and guests, one and all, as if by unquestioned consent,
had put away troubling thoughts and forgotten the
sorrows of the morrow in the joys of the day.  Beresford's
quips were never more brilliant.  Even Nasmith himself
forgot his pain and was satisfied to have Nancy next to
him, where he could watch glints of light from beneath
her long eyelashes as she answered the amused irony of
his sentences.
</p>

<p>
By common arrangement it was decided that Nancy
and Edward must be English during the two weeks of
their visit.  Yet it was a surprise to the man who hardly
dared admit himself her lover when he saw the girl in
the morning.  Elizabeth and Helen had repeated their magic
and led out a maiden who, save for a little hesitating
awkwardness, might have belonged to the West through all
her seventeen years.  Edward with his usual carelessness
of clothes had slipped easily into shirt and trousers, but
Nancy wore her dress of blue muslin with a deliberate
grace which charmed the attention of those who watched
her walk slowly forward.  The curve of her throat had
never had fair play behind the high collar of her Chinese
jacket; her hair was gathered loosely from her forehead
and bound round her head with just that effect of
wind-blown negligence which the twins, who had shared between
them the task of dressing their guest, delighted in as the
conspicuous triumph of their labor.  But the girl still moved
stiffly, not quite sure of herself before Nasmith's approving
glance, not quite sure of her bare arms and the tenuous
clothing of her legs, a little frightened for the exiguous
under fabrics into which they had made her step, not
thoroughly certain the men could not read the secret of
these dainty garments and how insecurely they seemed
to cling to her shoulders.  She kept her hands stiffly at her
sides lest her skirts, by which she was embarrassed enough
to expect any mischief, part company from the black silk
stockings which overreached her knees.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Elizabeth laughed at her qualms.  They could
not believe that trousers seemed more modest to Nancy
than the very ordinary rough-and-tumble dress in which
they had clothed her.  As they predicted, her shyness soon
passed, her shyness before all except Nasmith.  On him
her eyes persisted in lingering, yet she always flushed when
he turned to look at her.  The enigma of the couplet her
father had written still drew her fancy toward him while
it made her as quickly anxious to hide.  And Nasmith, much
as he tried to be cool, could never disguise his interest
in this pale stranger who for the breadth of a year had
lived like an incessant trouble in his brain.
</p>

<p>
His nieces, however, for the first few days took
command of their guest.  They postponed talk of Nancy's
marriage,&mdash;they could not bear to broach the subject nor
to think of it,&mdash;and gave up the time to picnics and
swimming parties and tennis.  Nancy enjoyed the long
walks, the start in the cool of the morning, the chattering
climb to some far-off temple where the trees provided
shade and the bushes, tangling among boulders, gave
covert in which the girls swiftly stripped off their clothes
and climbed into swimming suits for an hour's diving and
splashing in a clear warm pool.  Though she envied them,
she never could quite be persuaded to join them.  Edward
emerged fearlessly and was soon out with the men, swimming
like a young spaniel, but his sister allowed herself
only once to be led charily to the brink of the pool.  She
enjoyed watching the others at sport, the glossy figures of
the girls as they climbed dripping on to the rocks, the
antics of Beresford, who swam under water and seized
his shrieking victims by the ankles, Nasmith's supple
strength, which helped him, without apparent effort, to
outdistance the whole of them in the length of his dives
and the swiftness of his stroke through the water.
</p>

<p>
Then came tiffin, spread on a white cloth beneath the
pines.  There was a fastidious vein in Mrs. Ferris's nature
which would not let her dispense with what she called the
decencies of life, so that these meals, to the scoffing
amusement of her brother, never lacked the cloth and the dishes
or the glittering silver&mdash;she would die from starvation
rather than eat without them, Nasmith declared.  Nancy
heard the approving comment of the old amah, who was
telling the other servants that it was just this way that the
first Mrs. Herrick, the real Hai t'ai-t'ai, used to serve
picnics in those palmy days when she reigned as first Lady
of Amoy.  Nancy tried hard and gravely to connect this
actual link with the legend of her mother.
</p>

<p>
Luncheon was followed invariably by a long, drowsy
nap.  This Nancy liked best of all, for she could stretch
herself luxuriously in the shade of the bushes and talk
idly with Helen and Elizabeth till the sun, shining through
the leaves, filled her veins with its warmth and beguiled
her into sleep.  The birds sang more lazily, the breeze
barely stirred the pines, the water went deviating through
the rocks with a silver tinkle, the heat glimmered before
her half-shut eyes; she would wake to find it was tea time
and the girls hastily combing their hair or tightening the
garters round their stockings.  Then she too would jump
up, shake her dress free of pine needles, dash cold water
into her face, and hurry to take her place beside the festive
cloth.
</p>

<p>
At tea time the party was always at its gayest.  The
picnickers lay or sat cross-legged on the ground and
watched the golden sparkle of the tea as it was poured into
cup after cup.  The steaming liquid refreshed their spirits,
gave them appetite for sandwiches and dainty frosted
cakes.  Nancy was so happy that she did not think of
herself as a stranger but fell easily into family ways and
smiled at the family jokes, at the teasing of the twins
and their changeable-mooded sister, Patricia, who was
blossoming into a child of mercurially gay and serious
fancies.  Edward adapted himself even more quickly; he
both teased and was teased, flinging off banter as he
flung the spray from his forehead when he was swimming.
</p>

<p>
He could swagger and brag up to the last inch of David's
schoolboy manner.  But Nancy, though she was a laughing
partner to all this jesting, never quite became fair target
for their jokes.  Her destiny lurked, unspoken of yet not
unregarded, in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, she was braver than the others in putting
it out of mind, and no one could have told, from watching
her walk blithely home, now talking with one, now with
another of the party, that a heavy doom hung over her, a
doom which made the unpredictable future of her companions
seem play by comparison.  It was apparent, of course,
how the interests and affection of the whole family
hovered round her, but then she was singularly lovely;
her grave beauty had been made to attract interest and
affection.
</p>

<p>
She was enjoying herself, wholly careless of the passing
of time, only content that days like these should go on
forever.  She looked eagerly for the lights of the bungalow
gleaming through the trees, then the bustle, the washing,
the changing of clothes for dinner.  Such was the magic of
the twins, who rifled their wardrobe between them, that
she would appear in delicate silks trailing halfway to her
ankles, a circle of amber beads flashing their fire at her
throat, a ribbon of ivory satin half lost in her black hair,
but always the pensive look in her eyes, her lips, her whole
bearing, which suggested passion and desire so many ages
older than the transient fashions she graced.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith watched her with hungry eyes and it was only
Nancy's absorption in her two friends which kept his
secret from being guessed.  Her attention, for the moment,
was gladly filled by the commonplaces which were such
a luxurious novelty to her.  The gramophone, the games,
the bedroom gossip which trespassed on their sleep still
made every evening exciting.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday they took her to the little Anglican church.
They expected the occasion to be a great moment in her
life, but they overestimated her capacity for religious
feeling.  The experience was neither more nor less than the
many strange practices to which her eyes were being
opened.  Nancy had heard of the Christians,&mdash;she had
been reminded that their religion had been her mother's,&mdash;but
she felt no violent curiosity about their ways.
It seemed natural enough that the foreigners should have
their own religion, and one god the more was additional
security in time of trouble.  She thought the altar with its
cross seemly enough, so far as she thought of it at all,
but she was puzzled by the complications and the
uncomfortable formality of the service and wondered why
the priest wore vestments of funereal white and black.  To
the sermon she could give no response, having, even where
she understood the sentences, not the faintest clue to its
topic.
</p>

<p>
She did not criticize; no doubt this queer round of
prayers and hymns pleased the gods; there were so many
ways of pleasing the gods.  But her attention was mainly
caught by the people who sat round her.  The presence
of so many foreigners frightened her; she did not like
their peculiarities of dress, the untidy personal touches of
fashion, the hats of the women with their meaningless
flowers and fruits and vegetables, nor did she like the
beards and moustaches of the men.  Instinctively she drew
closer to her friends; she understood them even though
she resented the ease with which they joined in this alien
worship, but as for the others, they were strangers, no
kin of hers.
</p>

<p>
Her hosts were disappointed because she could give no
coherent impressions of the service.  Not that their
religion was too serious a burden to themselves; but it went
with the proper order of things, with the established
decencies of life, that they should be called "Dearly beloved
brethren" once a week, and the shallowness of their own
spiritual education, the very small teaching their Church
had given them, the easiness of the demands it imposed,
made them squirm at the thought that Nancy, after all,
was a heathen.  They had never analyzed the term beyond
the vague notion that she must worship idols&mdash;a really
undignified thing to do.  They were too ignorant of what
they themselves believed to venture into a debate with
the girl.  So they looked at her with concern, hoping the
service might have saved their pains by prompting godly
instincts, and feeling chagrin over so blank a failure.
They were well-meaning people; they felt the presence of
a duty, a duty they were both too helpless and too nice
to perform.  For a few hours Nancy was lonely and longed
to be back in her father's house.
</p>

<p>
But by Monday religion had been comfortably stowed
away for another week and the very faint shadow of
misunderstanding between Nancy and her hosts had been
dispelled.  She was up early, batting a tennis ball with
provoking awkwardness, but happy because she and
Nasmith beat every combination the family could muster
against them.  The exercise, the brisk morning air, the
smiles and applause of her friends, made her know she
was in favor again.  The girls would have laughed if they
had guessed yesterday's scruples: to think that of all their
many differences they should quarrel about religion!  A
more intriguing subject dawned upon their minds.
Nasmith's secret, his passion for Nancy, became suddenly
plain to eyes that had been blind.
</p>

<p>
"I do believe Ronald's in love with Nancy," Helen
blurted to her sister.  In the first delicious shock of
discovery they matched notes.  The fact could not be doubted.
Although no special indiscretion had betrayed the man,
the tale of his gaze which followed Nancy's every
movement had spoken too clearly.
</p>

<p>
"How splendid!" cried Elizabeth.  "Why didn't we
ever guess it before?"
</p>

<p>
It was a match so suitable, the girls both agreed, that
it ought to have been promoted, even without the
convincing proof of Ronald Nasmith's affection.  Here was the
one acceptable way of saving Nancy.
</p>

<p>
They rushed to their mother with the news.
</p>

<p>
"Ronald loves Nancy," they declared in concert.  "We
are sure of it."
</p>

<p>
"I know he does," said Mrs. Ferris quietly.
</p>

<p>
"But why didn't you tell us?  We ought to have helped
them.  What pigs we've been, keeping Nancy all to
ourselves!"
</p>

<p>
"It's Ronald's problem," smiled the mother.  "He will
have to manage it in his own way."
</p>

<p>
"But aren't you glad?"
</p>

<p>
"I am&mdash;very glad, if everything turns out well.  But it
won't be easy.  Nancy is in a difficult position, and she is
young."
</p>

<p>
"Everything must turn out well," vowed Elizabeth.  "Do
you think Nancy likes him?"
</p>

<p>
"Nancy is a very inexperienced child.  How can she
know what she likes?"
</p>

<p>
"She's older than we are," Helen protested.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferris smiled again.
</p>

<p>
"You are only children yourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, mother," the daughter exclaimed, "don't talk
stuff like that to us.  You ought to know better.  Even
Pat wouldn't swallow such old-fashioned language.  What
do you really think about Nancy?  Does she like Ronald?"
</p>

<p>
"I should not be surprised if she did," Mrs. Ferris
conceded, with the amused, secretive look which convinced
them that she was stating only half of what she had
seen.
</p>

<p>
"Then we must help them."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too impetuous, my dears.  I should like
Ronald to have Nancy, mind you; she is a very sweet girl.
But she isn't free, you know, and unless Ronald is sure
of getting her, it might make her miserable for life if
she liked him too well.  You know how she's been brought
up and you know that her father has arranged for her to
be married.  We have to reckon with the father.  And we
have to reckon with her too&mdash;alas, she is a more obedient
daughter than mine.  Suppose she should come to love
Ronald and then be forced into marriage with that
Chinese&mdash;what would her life be?"
</p>

<p>
"But you don't really consider such a ghastly event
possible!" cried Elizabeth, her eyes ablaze with indignation.
"We've got to prevent it, and this is our chance."
</p>

<p>
"We have to consider it, whether we wish to or not,"
the mother answered.  For the first time she did not smile.
Her eyes were sad.
</p>

<p>
Despite this reluctant warning, the twins were convinced
of their duty to further the match.  By fair means or foul
it had to be achieved.  They were not afraid of Nancy's
father nor did they weigh very seriously the fact of her
engagement.
</p>

<p>
"He seemed a nice old man," said Helen, "and if he
were likely to disapprove, why should he let Nancy visit
us?"
</p>

<p>
What appalled the girls was the time they had lost,
the five precious days in which they had done nothing to
help Nancy and Ronald to an understanding.  They must
make immediate amends, use every occasion to leave the
man and the girl to themselves.  But occasions did not
come so easily as they wished.  The habit of even five
days could not easily be broken.  Nancy seemed to detect
each effort at desertion and cling more nearly to her
friends.  They could not lead her bluntly to Nasmith and
say, "There you are; love him."  They could only steal
away on this pretext and that, but these manufactured
meetings left an atmosphere of constraint, so that the girl
grew shy in the presence of her lover and seized her own
chance to escape.  And there was always Patricia or David
or Edward in the way.  Half an evening was consumed in
luring them out of the room, for the younger children,
suspicious of being beguiled out of some advantage, like
a child enticed to bed when fun is brewing downstairs,
held their places with maddening obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
"I declare," stormed Elizabeth, "marriages may be made
in heaven, but I wish there was a little more help in
making them on earth!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
</h3>

<p>
The visit was almost at its end.  The girls were in
despair.
</p>

<p>
"We won't let you go home," they told Nancy.  "You
must have another week, at least.  Surely your father
won't mind."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he won't," she agreed, "but I must go back
and ask him."
</p>

<p>
She was no more ready than they were to have her stay
finished.  Time had gone so swiftly.  The first few days
she had been careless of its passing, as though she had the
leisure of years before her, but now each day was
oppressed by the closer approach of the end.  It would be
the end to so many things, the end to her youth, to her
freedom, her all too brief season of play.  Nancy wished
at times she had never known these friends; she would
not have missed them so.  Barely a month remained till
her marriage.  She looked at the moon shining through the
trees.  Even now it was at the first quarter.  The next time
she should see it thus, she would be back in Peking, the
centre of odious preparation, half enslaved already, and
before she could see it again she would be married, hidden
in some brawling Chihli village where her mother-in-law
might not give her time to watch the slow processions of
the sky.
</p>

<p>
The praise of the twins had awakened a delight in her
own beauty.  She would stand slowly undressing before the
mirror, extending her arms, admiring the rounded softness
of her shoulders, the glint of light upon her long silk
stockings.  She reddened with shame and with fear at the
thought of giving her body to the mercy of a stranger.
</p>

<p>
Not new thoughts were these, but for the first time
intimately felt, and by contrast the quick comradeship
which prevailed in the Ferris family made their home the
treasure-house of all things desirable.  Whatever she might
predict of her future home, she knew it would not be
like theirs.  She dared less to think how different it might
be.  She wanted security.  She wanted peace of soul.  She
wanted the grave trust of a man like Nasmith.  She did
not know that, with all her rapt joy in the company of
the twins, her one desire from waking till sleeping was
to appear lovely in his eyes.  "I was the moon&mdash;I
was&mdash;" she mused once or twice, and checked herself
dreaming before the long mirror.
</p>

<p>
Nasmith too had come down from counting days to
counting hours.  A whole ten days with Nancy near&mdash;they
had promised so much and been nothing but tantalization
and sorrow.  And now but one day lay before him.
The conversation of the dinner table turned to his rescue
of Nancy a year ago.  Beresford revived the story with
sundry mock-heroic touches, descanting upon the
execution Edward had done with his bow till he made their
intervention seem merely a belated attempt to save the
lives of the monks.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go back there, Nancy?" said Nasmith, half
in play, half trying to veil the bitter seriousness of his
eyes, "and see if we can remember it all?  It was so long
ago, it has begun to seem almost a joke."
</p>

<p>
His suggestion was taken up eagerly by the girls.  They
had not consented to thinking of the morrow as Nancy's
last day among them; she must win her father's agreement
to a longer visit; but, if last day it were, a slight
trembling in Ronald's voice told them he would make the
most of it.  So early the next day they started with all
the paraphernalia of these outings to make holiday high
among the rocky shoulders of the mountains.  The sun
shone in broad waves of light down the grassy slopes;
the paths were still wet with dew.
</p>

<p>
"Who shall lead the way?" Nasmith asked.
</p>

<p>
"You and Nancy, you must be the pilgrims," called out
Beresford cheerily.
</p>

<p>
The twins had trusted him with their secret.
</p>

<p>
"Do you love Nancy?" Helen had demanded of him
the night before.  "Yes, of course I love Nancy," he had
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't be stupid," the girl retorted, stamping her
foot.  "Do you <i>love</i> her?"
</p>

<p>
"I will, if you wish," Beresford answered gallantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't wish it.  If you're really and truly sure
you don't love her, I want you to keep David and Edward
in hand when we go to the temple; find a tiger for them,
even if you have to buy one&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't I be a tiger myself?  I look well in
stripes,&mdash;some have been ungracious enough to suggest my
wearing them permanently,&mdash;and if you can give me some
hint of how a tiger roars or whether a tiger does roar
or merely sits on his hind feet and purrs,&mdash;I won't do
that, mind you,&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am not joking," Helen broke in.  "I want you to
keep the boys amused so that Ronald can have a chance."
</p>

<p>
"Right-o," he said, suddenly understanding.  He was a
little saddened, for the habit of seeing Nancy was
growing on him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm late in the race," he thought to himself.
"I can't complain."  So, at Helen's command, he was
tactfully alert to every chance of helping what he supposed,
in his simple way, were lovers.
</p>

<p>
"You are the pilgrims," he called, "you must brave the
thorny places of the wilderness.  Young Edward and I
will hold our trusty bows in reserve.  If you chance upon
peril, give three piercing cries,&mdash;you'd better make them
two shorts and a long so we won't be led astray on
other adventure and fail you in your need,&mdash;three
piercing shrieks, and we'll tumble to your assistance."
</p>

<p>
Laughingly Ronald took up his post of guide, with
Nancy halfway between him and the twins, while Beresford
kept his two young cubs in leash by the sheer interest
of his talk, and hallooed cheerfully to Mrs. Ferris
to make sure that she and her mountain chair were still
pursuing.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Though fa-int, yet pursuing, we go on our way,"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he would hum, and then break off, reproaching himself
with a grimace for such irreverent use of a hymn.
Meanwhile the twins, satisfied with the arrangement of the
party, slowly widened the interval between themselves and
Nancy, very cautiously, of course, not too quickly nor too
far, lest the girl suspect, yet far enough so that her
walking and talking with Ronald could become the habit of
the day.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's the grove," said Ronald, at last.  Nancy
had been taught to call him by his name, "the communism
of the family," he had assured her.  "Now what shall we
do?"
</p>

<p>
They waited for the party to draw up.
</p>

<p>
"I smell water," exclaimed Mrs. Ferris.
</p>

<p>
"There is a stream in a ravine close by," offered
Beresford, who had explored these mountains inch by inch
with his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Splendid, just the place we need for tiffin.  Tiffin
before temples, my dears."
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the edge of the ravine and slipped
down the gravelly path to the rocks below.
</p>

<p>
"There must be swimming somewhere," said Elizabeth,
prying round.  Soon shouts and splashing told the story
of her success.  She and Helen came back, gay and
dishevelled, their wet swimming suits under their arms,
pulled up Beresford, who had been soberly showing
Edward and David how to make whistles from the pliant
twigs of the trees, and gayly the family sat down to a meal
which had been spread with the usual elegance.  They
lingered a long time over the coffee, while the men smoked
pipes and outdid each other with the stories they told.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to sleep," said Mrs. Ferris, finally.
"You had better show Nancy her temple, Ronald, before
it's too late."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come and see it?" the man asked.
</p>

<p>
Something in the eagerness of his voice made her hesitate,
but after a long pause she said yes.  He got up silently
and she followed, while the rest sat watching, with no
word to say, for they were wondering in their hearts
what the issue would be.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was hot and oppressive; a haze was veiling
the sun.  The pines stood like trees of an enchanted
wood.  Not a branch moved.  The silver trunks glistened
in the heat.  Nancy was dumb and uneasy as though the
sultry weather were laying its spell upon her as it veiled
the sun.  She knew this was no ordinary chance, this walk,
and waited fearfully for Ronald to speak, to break the
quiet which lay so heavy upon her breast.
</p>

<p>
"We are pilgrims, Nancy," he said.  "I wish I knew
what is to be the end of our pilgrimage."
</p>

<p>
But he left off talking riddles.  A look in the girl's face
warned him that the time was not ripe.  It was easier to
relieve the tense atmosphere with light-hearted mention
of that day a year ago when he and Beresford had been
walking this selfsame path without thought of the
adventure they were to meet.  He pointed out the place where
Edward had run into them, pictured the monks stopping
foolishly a few paces away.  He was almost as amusing as
Beresford in his way of telling the story, but he had seen
more deeply than his friend the tragedy they foiled, so
that his words never quite lost the graver tones of a scene
which he remembered almost as much with pain as with
joy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's your temple," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked with a slight shock of panic, but the red
walls were harmless enough, almost pitiful and desolate,
under a sky that was growing gray.
</p>

<p>
They stopped for a moment before entering.  Inside,
the temple seemed dark and musty.  The monks were
asleep.  Ronald had to shout before one of them appeared,
startled by visitors he had not expected.  Nancy
recognized him,&mdash;he was the younger of the two priests who
had welcomed Edward and herself,&mdash;but, to her surprise,
he gave her only a blank stare.  Her Western dress was
effectual disguise.  Quickly he brought tea and, pulling off
the lid of a round black box, gave them handfuls of
melon seeds, dried jujubes, cakes of powdered rice.  The
tea was too hot; Ronald was restless.  He got up and
studied the musty gods and turned to Nancy, who had
too many evil memories of the place to trust her friend
out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we look at your prison?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No!" protested the girl.
</p>

<p>
"It is a worse prison you are going to," he commented
dryly, "far worse.  Why don't you show the same fear for
the future that you show for the harmless memory of
the past?  I saved you from one.  Ah, Nancy, why won't
you let me save you from the other?"
</p>

<p>
She looked past him at the gods on their lotus blossoms,
and made no answer.  Ronald watched her, noted the
masses of dark hair piled low round her forehead, the
tranced stare of her eyes, the slow curve of her throat,
arms half bare, hands far too smooth and supple for
the rough-grained table on which they were stretched.
</p>

<p>
"You were not meant for prison, Nancy," he said gently.
</p>

<p>
But the appeal of his words was frustrated by the
entrance of the monk.  Every moment the girl expected his
yellow-toothed confederate to appear.
</p>

<p>
"I can't talk here," she said.  "This place hurts me.  It
chokes me."
</p>

<p>
The man, however, was unwilling to leave the cobwebbed
hall.  An unbelievable superstition held him here because
this had been the place they had named for their
pilgrimage.  He felt the influence of the dusky temple
fighting his battle in Nancy's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see?" he cried in a low voice.  "Doesn't
this place show you what I mean?  Nancy, Nancy, you
say it hurts you, chokes you.  What chokes you?  Just
the memory of a danger long ago.  What is that compared
with the marriage you are facing?  A laugh and a smile.
If you can't bear to think in this mouldy, decaying place
because the walls stifle you with torturing thoughts, what
are you going to do when you have no friend, no protection,
when life really begins to choke and to hurt&mdash;when
they lock you into a red chair and send you away to
be the slave of strangers?"
</p>

<p>
"I will stop doing.  I will stop thinking," answered
Nancy simply, as though deed and thought could be laid
away like garments too rich for the everyday wear of
life.
</p>

<p>
"No, Nancy," Ronald demurred, shaking his head, "you
will never be able to stop thinking and, worse yet, to
stop feeling."
</p>

<p>
The priest, finding his company unwanted, had withdrawn
softly to the next hall and was watching his guests
curiously through a crack in the door.
</p>

<p>
"You can never stop feeling," Ronald persisted.
</p>

<p>
"You are a Westerner," said Nancy bravely; "you
don't understand our customs."
</p>

<p>
"I understand this much, Nancy, that you don't want
to be married in this cruel way any more than you want
to die."
</p>

<p>
In fact he thought she would rather die, but he did not
like to say this openly, lest he put the thought into her
head.
</p>

<p>
"One has to marry," the girl remarked calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but there are two ways of marrying.  You have
chosen the wrong one."
</p>

<p>
"Chosen!" she said indignantly.  "I haven't chosen
anything.  I can't stop the winter from coming, can I?  How
can I stop being married?  When it's time to be married,
I'm married."
</p>

<p>
"You're only arguing to hide your own fear.  You know
as well as I do that this whole business is ghastly and
wrong."
</p>

<p>
"What should I do?" she asked, vexed by the truth
of his words.
</p>

<p>
"You should break the engagement, tell your father
you won't consider it."
</p>

<p>
"And bring shame to my father."
</p>

<p>
"Better shame for him than for you.  After all, it would
only be an artificial shame for him, a short-lived one at
that; for you it would be all too real&mdash;and lifelong."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stood up, tired of hearing things she knew too
well.
</p>

<p>
"You are kind," she said, "and it's very simple according
to your ways, but these are things that can't be mended
by talk."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," commanded the man, "I haven't even begun
to say what I intended.  I am not trying to mend a bad
matter by talk.  There is a better way.  I know your
father wanted you to marry me, else why should he have
offered me the engagement?  It was only annoyance, pride,
injured vanity, whatever you choose to call it, that made
him arrange this other hapless engagement.  He has gained
nothing by it, not even the terms he tried to exact from
me.  He has managed to keep you only one of the four
years he stipulated.  Do you think he is happy over this
business into which he has drifted so helplessly?  He is
no happier than you or I.  Ah, Nancy, why can't you
see it, why can't you see that worry is killing him&mdash;worry
over what is to become of you?  If you wish to save
his life, you must disobey him; you must not go back;
you must stay and marry me."
</p>

<p>
By now Nancy had grown used to this habit of frank
speech.  Ronald's pregnant ending was outweighed by his
accusation that she was killing her father.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," she said.  "I can't think of these things
here."
</p>

<p>
She wanted swift motion to keep time with the wheeling
circles of her brain.
</p>

<p>
"But you cannot go now," cried her lover, suddenly
conscious that he had been stamping out his words to the
rumbling accompaniment of thunder.  There was a bright
flash, an ear-shattering explosion; the two stood speechless,
stunned, certain the temple had been struck.  Then
Ronald laughed nervously; he could hear the rain sweeping
toward them through the trees; nearer and nearer it
came, like the menacing roar of a great wind, till it hissed
through the branches and burst upon the tiles of the temple
roof with an awful noise, more deafening than the clatter
of stones.  Lightning seethed round the temple, illuminating
the darkest corner with incessant brilliance as bolt
after bolt flared down the sides of the mountains; thunder
and rain were mixed in an inseparable welter of sound.
</p>

<p>
"You can't go now," Ronald shouted; "we must wait
until the storm has passed on."
</p>

<p>
He went back and stirred up the frightened monk to
bring them more tea.  Nancy was sitting with her arms
stretched across the table, her hands clenched, her eyes
intent upon ghosts she could not see, ghosts of herself and
Ronald and her father.  Ronald's speech was so terribly
plausible, it matched her father's unforgettable
couplet&mdash;the sun and the moon; the words came back to torment
the one paltry bit of peace she had cherished, the peace of
obeying her father.  She tried to put Ronald out of the
debate, to exclude the charm which had been working
silent mischief in her heart.  She wanted to think entirely
of her father, to please him, to save him; the failure of
her labored attempts for his safety, the battle she had done
against Kuei-lien's schemes, made her look carefully,
gravely, at the bewildering implications of Ronald's
undreamed-of project, that by defying her father she could
make him happy.
</p>

<p>
The tumult of the storm relieved her of speech.  She
sat and stared, and let her tea grow cold.  The lightning
flashed less frequently, but the rain held and the temple
was steeped in unnatural darkness, a perilous gloom which
oppressed her with hatred of the place.  Again, a second
time, it had become her prison.  Surely there was nothing
but mischief in store for the pilgrims who paid their
vows here.
</p>

<p>
"The rain is stopping," Ronald reminded.  "Have you
any answer to make?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no answer," Nancy replied.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to put all my words aside without a
thought?" asked the man in despair.
</p>

<p>
"I have thought&mdash;I have thought many times; but I
must go back.  My father let me come here; he trusted me.
If I did not go back, it would be shame and evil to him.
How can I dare to break his promise?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you understand, don't you see, Nancy?  Must
I go over it all again!  He doesn't want this marriage.  It
is only his stubbornness, his obstinacy that makes him
cling to it.  I showed you his own words, the scrolls he
wrote for me; he told me that these were the truth and
that the best part of my life would come when I found
out the meaning for myself.  If they were the truth, then
your marriage is false and your father is false to himself,
false to his own heart's desire in allowing it.  It will
kill him; remember that&mdash;it will kill him."
</p>

<p>
Ronald saw that his earnestness had made a deep
impression; he hurried to strengthen his advantage.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Nancy," he went on, "I have read his words,
his scrolls, read them for myself, and I know that he was
right, that the best part of my life will come not only
from understanding them but from realizing their meaning
in actual life.  You don't belong to the East, Nancy,
you belong to the West whence you came; it is my happiness
to take you back to the West of your birth.  That
is my lot and my destiny because I know in my heart I
love you.  I have been learning this through all the troubled
months of the past year.  I love you, Nancy; my claim
upon you is greater than your father's; it is the claim to
which he appointed me.  His claim is passing, his life is
nearly run.  He will die, but we must live."
</p>

<p>
The girl listened to him in breathless quiet.  Tumult,
agitation, had frozen her muscles so that her face in the
dim light showed neither anger nor joy, merely a ghostly
whiteness, an unblinking passivity like the gilded immobile
calm of the gods.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said the girl after a long silence.
"You should tell these things to my father, not to me."
</p>

<p>
"No," protested the man, "it is time to tell them to you,
to make you understand.  You are not blind, Nancy, you
have been with us, you know something of the life I wish
to offer you.  No hiding away in an ignorant village, no
father-in-law and mother-in-law and a whole courtyard
of mangy relations tyrannizing over you, but your own
home, friends to visit and be visited, and a husband who
will love and reverence your slightest wish.  Ah, Nancy,
how can I tell you these things, how can I make you know
that I love you, that life won't be life for me if I cannot
have you?"
</p>

<p>
"These things should not be said to me," said Nancy,
her voice burdened with pain.  "You are late, late!  Why
do you say such things when you know it is useless,
when you know my father has promised and I have
promised?  I have no power.  I cannot call back spoken
words, my spoken words."
</p>

<p>
"Then you do not love me," said Ronald, in a low,
discouraged voice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," faltered the girl, unable to say the
one phrase which would have quelled his importunity,
unable to accept him, unable to give him up.  "I don't
understand this&mdash;this love."
</p>

<p>
"You are fighting against your own heart," said Ronald.
"You are making the mistake which has tortured your
father for years.  Give me an answer, Nancy.  This is no
time for holding to foolish promises; it is no time for
dainty, meticulous points of honor.  Your father's life
rests in your hands.  You will hurt him if you don't go
back; you will kill him if you do.  I don't mind your
sacrificing me,&mdash;I do mind, of course, but we'll not stop
to argue over it,&mdash;but will you sacrifice your father?
Will you sacrifice yourself?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy's composure was shaken.  She was exhausted by
the strain of arguing against everything she desired.
Ronald was trying to persuade her to things whereof she
longed only too ardently to be persuaded.  She was worn
out by the thankless irony of defending her own worst
interests.  She could not deny that she loved Ronald; she
could not confess that she did; her heart was in a fever
of eagerness to put into his masterful hands the knotted
strings of her life, but her will, even when half convinced,
balked at an act which, however surely it might lead to
her father's ultimate welfare, would be desertion and
disloyalty to his trust.
</p>

<p>
The rain had stopped.  There was only the sound of
water dripping from the trees to remind her that they
must join the others, discover how they had fared in the
deluge.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say yes, Ronald," she announced in unthinkably
clear tones, "and I cannot say no.  I don't know what
to say.  You called this a pilgrimage.  Then I am a
pilgrim and I shall get my answer as the pilgrims do."
</p>

<p>
She stood up, pushed back her stool with a clatter
which brought the listening monk to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Get me some incense," she commanded.
</p>

<p>
One by one she took out the frail sticks from the
packet he brought, and round the temple she went, lighting
a stick before each god and thrusting it deep into the
ashes of the porcelain burner before she did obeisance
with clasped hands held stiff in front of her.  The eighteen
Lo-han she worshiped, Kuan-yin and the gods of the four
mountains, at the back, and then returned to the main hall
to kneel prostrate before the three lotus-throned Buddhas.
Ronald looked on with amazement and dismay at the
outrageously incongruous picture of this foreign girl in
Western clothes performing an act so unnatural to her
appearance.  The sight did violence to his imagination, this
vision of Nancy with knees pressed upon a dirty prayer-mat
of straw, the lace edges of her skirts draggled in the
mire, her hair tumbling over her shoulders as she bowed
before these pitiless, imperturbable gods.  Yet he was too
much fascinated by the weirdness of the scene to think
of intervening.
</p>

<p>
The priest had been surprised, too; he had recognized
the girl at the first sound of her vigorous Chinese speech.
This time Nancy had the upper hand; she gave her commands
quickly and clearly so that he was only too prompt
to obey.  He stood by the bell while she chanted her appeal
to the gods, a strange petition that they should tell her
whether she ought to obey or disobey her father.  Three
times she bowed, three times he struck deep full-toned
reverberations from his bell.  With the last note Nancy
seized a round bamboo box from the table in front of her;
she shook it and threw the bamboo counters to the floor.
The gods must tell her which was right, to go back to her
father or not to go back, to yield to the scarlet chair and
to Chou Ming-te for her husband or to remain and marry
Ronald.
</p>

<p>
The bamboo counters fell with curved sides uppermost.
"No," the gods told her, "you are not to go back."
</p>

<p>
But the girl could not break her trust even for the gods.
</p>

<p>
"This is an evil place," she said, turning calmly to
Ronald.  "I know now that I cannot do what you wish.
I must go back as I promised."
</p>

<p>
Ronald followed her dumbly through the dripping trees.
Inwardly he cursed the superstition that could pin a great
choice upon the chance fall of two bamboo counters.  He
was too bitter to speak, bitter over this childish, futile
end to their pilgrimage.  He was almost ready to despise
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
He never guessed that the gods had been on his side&mdash;that
the girl had thrown over their advice, thrown over
his, thrown over her own.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
</h3>

<p>
They found the rest of the family where they had left
them.  A cave to which the storm had driven them had
saved the picnickers from the worst of the downpour
although the swift rise of the stream had threatened for
a few anxious minutes to engulf them.  Ronald saw by
their faces, however, that their concern had not been
over their own plight, but over his; he read their unspoken
queries about the outcome of his suit.  He had never
confided in them and could not confide now.
</p>

<p>
"We were delayed in the temple till the rain passed
over," he explained.  The words were enough to show that
he had failed.  Nancy had a look of proud reserve with
which none of them dared meddle.
</p>

<p>
The picnic ended with drooping spirits; that this was
the last hung heavy on the minds of all, the last and too
late.  Dinner was no merrier.  The unspoken failure of
the afternoon hushed the usually careless talk.  Only
Edward and David, who were not imaginative, chattered on
in their heroic style, enlarging their remarks to fit the
silence which was offered them.
</p>

<p>
"Ronald, you are a bungler," scolded Elizabeth, when
she had a chance of catching her uncle alone.
</p>

<p>
"A bungler?" echoed the man.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a bungler!  Don't you suppose we know your
secret?  We had counted on you, for the honor of the
family, to save Nancy."
</p>

<p>
Ronald gave a wan smile.
</p>

<p>
"Since you know so much," he said, "how would you
save Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
"Marry her, stupid!  Haven't we all been doing everything
we could to help you?  Why on earth do you suppose
we let you go chasing off to that temple by yourselves?
Just think of all the trouble we had, reining in David and
that impetuous young brother of hers.  I am ashamed
of you, thoroughly ashamed of you."
</p>

<p>
Ronald was used to the stormings of his niece,
</p>

<p>
"It's not nearly so simple as you think, my dear
Betty," he laughed, "even with your all-powerful help.
Nancy is already engaged and if she thinks two
engagements are a complication, what am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
"What are you to do?  What does any man with any
pluck do?  What does her engagement amount to&mdash;you
know what it is&mdash;to a Chinese!  Are you going to sit
idle-handed and see her thrown away like that?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't sat idle-handed, but when Nancy proves a
peculiarly stubborn young lady,&mdash;like some other persons
I know but won't mention,&mdash;that's the end of it.  I could
hardly follow the precedent of our friends, the monks,
and kidnap her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, kidnapping would be better than letting her go
back to that horrible marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Betty, I wish the man luck who tries to kidnap you!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I shall have to propose for you," said
Elizabeth with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Propose by all means; but don't imagine I have lost
Nancy for lack of proposing."
</p>

<p>
"I can fancy the way you would propose.  Drew it up
as a brief, no doubt, with preamble, articles one, two,
three, and four, and half a dozen 'whereases.'  If it had
only been Beresford instead of you we might have had
some hope of success."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately it wasn't Beresford," said Ronald, and
walked away.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth had no mind to acquiesce in Ronald's surrender,
and throughout a dreary evening, in which the spirit
had left the forms of their amusements vacant, her brain
was busy with arguments for beating down Nancy's
obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
"This can't really be your last night here," she said,
when bedtime had come and she and Helen and Nancy
were in the privacy of their own room.  "We won't
allow it."
</p>

<p>
"I must go back to my father first," Nancy answered
in a firm voice.  "I must ask him if I can stay longer."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I know what that means.  It means you won't
come back.  Honestly, Nancy, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it does," the other girl admitted.
</p>

<p>
"And it means you will have to marry that Chinese."
</p>

<p>
Nancy was startled.  The fact of her engagement had
always lurked between them, but had never been mentioned.
She had hoped this last night might pass without
its being mentioned.  But the fiery Elizabeth was tired of
evasions.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it?" she challenged.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Nancy confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked her relentless questioner.
</p>

<p>
"Because it has been arranged."
</p>

<p>
"Did you arrange it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my father arranged it; that's our custom."
</p>

<p>
"And are you going to let yourself be handed over to
an ugly Chinaman you have never seen just because of
your father's whim?"
</p>

<p>
Helen thought the question a little harshly put and
opened her mouth to repeat her sister's words more gently,
but Elizabeth frowned her into silence.  Nancy's face
was white, but the girl was still sufficiently mistress of her
lips to answer with an even-toned composure:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is our custom, you see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is not our custom, and you are one of us, Nancy.
It is an unthinkable, disgraceful thing!  It is bad enough
that you should have had all the best years of your life
stolen from you because of your father's selfishness in
bringing you up like a Chinese, but to be handed over to a
greasy mandarin or coolie or whatever he is, that is more
than you have any business to allow.  You've got to do
something to bring the man to his senses."
</p>

<p>
"My father is my father," said Nancy, a little stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"You're going too far, Betty," protested Helen, and
then turned to Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be offended," she begged.  "That's just Betty's
way of expressing herself.  She's not trying to be insulting.
I've known her since she was born, so you must believe
me.  We are not criticizing your father; he has his ideas
and we have ours, but he is old and you are young, and he
has lived by himself so long that he probably doesn't
know quite what is fair to you.  You see you aren't
truly Chinese, Nancy; anybody could know that by looking
at you.  But he has been living so long with his Chinese
books and all that,"&mdash;gracefully she included the concubines
in the "all that,"&mdash;"as to have forgotten that you
aren't Chinese."
</p>

<p>
Nancy was mollified, but Elizabeth, once aroused, did
not like apologies being made for her own frankness.
</p>

<p>
"He might at least have tried to find an English husband
for you," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"He did try," said Nancy, enjoying the sensation of
her statement.
</p>

<p>
"He did try?  When?" both sisters cried in unison.
</p>

<p>
"Last year, but&mdash;" Nancy added, with a faint spice
of malice, "I was&mdash;rejected."
</p>

<p>
A light burst suddenly upon Elizabeth's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say he asked Ronald?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
This Western game of frankness had its triumphs even
in defeat, Nancy was able to observe during the pause
which ensued.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am&mdash;yes, I am damned!" exclaimed Elizabeth.
"There's no other word for it.  I see it now, and that's
why we have had to put up with his hangdog looks all
these months.  I suppose he submitted a whole code of
regulations and provisos, didn't he, and your father was
not willing to accept?  That's just what he would do."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what he did do," said Nancy, shifting to
the defense of her lover.  "Perhaps my father had his
own code of regulations and provisos, if that's what you
call them."
</p>

<p>
"And he never said a word to us," Elizabeth continued.
"Oh, why are men so stupid?"
</p>

<p>
"He is not stupid," said Nancy; "he didn't understand
our customs."
</p>

<p>
"Did he tell you about this?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And now, as usual, he's a year too late.  He'll be a year
too late for his funeral.  Look here, Nancy," she asked,
with a disconcerting change of tactics, "do you love
Ronald?"
</p>

<p>
A whisper of warning came from Helen.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know it's a beastly question, but you do love
him, don't you, Nancy?  Of course you can't expect us to
reverence our own uncle.  We shall have to be foolish
over someone else's uncle.  We will spare you the mention
of all Ronald's endearing little faults if you'll just say
you love him."
</p>

<p>
Her pleasantries saved Nancy the embarrassment of an
immediate reply.  Her eyes, the sudden rush of blood to
her cheeks, might have seemed to give her answer, but the
girl's tongue took refuge in the same answer it had given
Ronald himself.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand this love."
</p>

<p>
"That's nonsense," vowed Elizabeth; "you know if you
love him&mdash;and you do love him.  It's no use denying it.
You daren't look me in the eyes and say you don't."
</p>

<p>
Nancy evaded the challenge.  She did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do love Ronald," cried her accuser in triumph.
"Don't try to hide your face, Nancy dear; I know
the symptoms.  Now you can't go back."
</p>

<p>
She spoke as if the matter had been decided and nothing
remained except to give Nancy to her lover.  But Nancy
was not so easily beaten down.  She looked quite calmly
into the eyes of the friend whom a minute ago she had
been afraid to face.
</p>

<p>
"I love my father," she said, "and I must go back."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth gave a gesture of vexation at the stupid way
people insisted upon tangling their own happiness.  For a
moment she was speechless, leaving argument to her less
overbearing sister.
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't as if you were going back to your father,"
insisted Helen, "not for more than a few weeks.  You are
going to a husband whom you don't love, whom you have
never seen.  That is not right, Nancy, not right for you,
not right for Ronald, because you do love him and you
know it.  You are going back just to please an old man, and
not to please him for long."
</p>

<p>
"I am going back to please my father.  I want to please
him.  I don't care how long it is."
</p>

<p>
"But if he has made a mistake&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My father doesn't make mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doesn't he?" snorted Elizabeth, unable to keep
out of the debate longer.  "What has he been doing all
these years but make mistakes?  And now he is too selfish,
he isn't man enough, to save his daughter from the mess
he has made.  He has ruined his own life and isn't happy
till he has ruined yours."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's eyes flashed with anger.
</p>

<p>
"I am going now," she said.  "I won't stay in your
house and hear such words.  My father is right.  Everything
he does is right.  I am not a foreigner.  I hate your ways,
I hate your ugly clothes, all your talk about love!  My
father is not selfish, he is not selfish!  I won't listen to
you.  I am going home."
</p>

<p>
She clutched wildly at her dress.  In her passion she was
ready to tear off the despised garments.  Then suddenly
the sense of her own helplessness overwhelmed her and she
knew that she had insulted these, almost her only friends
in the world.  The experiences of the day had been too
great for her sorely tried nerves.  She had fought against
all she desired until there was no strength for battle left
in her veins.  She was standing, unable to move, wondering
where she could go, how she could carry out her frantic
threats of flight, when the instantly contrite Elizabeth
threw her arms across the shoulders of the distracted girl.
</p>

<p>
"I was a beast, Nancy," she confessed; "do forgive me,
do forget everything I said.  I didn't mean to spoil your
last evening here, but you seem to belong so much to us
that I couldn't bear not to say what I could."
</p>

<p>
Helen too was plying her with penitent words.
</p>

<p>
Nancy's anger dissolved under their kindness.  Their
love touched her heart to the quick.  She could not
control herself longer; her pride, her anger, her remorse,
were swept away in tears.  She tried to struggle through a
few incoherent phrases, but the tide of weeping drowned
speech, drowned thoughts, drowned everything except a
devastating pity which convulsed her breast with great
heaving sobs and set her weeping again and again after
the wells of her eyes had seemed eternally drained of
tears.
</p>

<p>
There was no more the girls could say.  They could only
let her weep away the bitterness of her heart.
</p>

<p>
When she got up at the first glimmer of dawn and put
on again her Chinese clothes, they did not stop her, for
they knew quite well she had not slept and must find her
bed wearisome after the vigil of the night.  She would
be better breathing the cool air of the morning.  They let
her go alone to purge her brain in the dew and the
sunshine of the hills.
</p>

<p>
"I will be back," Nancy told them, "but I want to walk.
I shall feel better; then I can sleep in the chair all the way
home."
</p>

<p>
She hurried round the upper paths of the settlement,
passing houses which were heavy with slumber.  The
morning was still; the sun had not come up over the plains
to waken the dragon flies into humming life.  Nancy was
trying to walk herself out of the desperate mood in which
nothing she did seemed worth any pain.  She had gained
some satisfaction, when she was angry, from the heroism
of returning to her father, which of course was only
another way of saying to the marriage he had ordained.
But now she was not angry, only sad.  Her heroism was
only like a memory of last night's acting lingering in
the stale air, amid the litter and refuse of a stage, the
morning after a great tragedy.  The actors have gone, the
theatre is given up to charwomen.  So Nancy's heart was
given up to dustpans and brooms.  The anguish upon which
she had wracked her spirit lay strewn across the floor of
her soul like crumpled flowers.  It was bad enough to be
sacrificing so much that she loved to the demands of duty,
but it was worse not to believe in the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
In this mood Ronald overtook her.
</p>

<p>
"I am going back to my father," she announced, as
though he had been following the debate in her mind and
might try to prolong fruitless argument and score many
profitless points.
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it," said Ronald, smiling gravely.  "I
don't doubt that you are going back.  I didn't come to
plague you with my efforts at persuasion.  I wanted just
one last walk with you, Nancy, to be at peace and happy
because you are with me.  I am wiser than I was yesterday,
and I know you would have agreed if you could.
So we'll let it rest at that, shall we?"
</p>

<p>
They walked quietly, enjoying the little things that
caught their eyes, the brilliant touches of an early
summer morning, "my namesake, the sun,"&mdash;as Ronald
grimly remarked,&mdash;which came up from a saffron bed of
clouds, far across the plains beyond Peking.  Nancy was
glad Ronald had found her.  There was an unforced merriment
to his talk which cheered her vexed mind.  Her doubts
vanished like the mist.  He was well named "the sun," for
his steadfast courtesy in defeat shed light on the misty
passes of her will and helped her to see the rightness
of the instinct which was taking her back to her father.
The mountains had lost their vagueness of surface; the
sun was etching the deep shadows of each ravine.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is time we went back," said Ronald, after they
had walked a long way and seen the sun leap high above
the plains.  "I am glad we had this walk, Nancy, because I
didn't trust myself to say good-bye to you down there.
I haven't given you up, you know; I will never do that,
for I hope against hope that your father's prediction may
yet come true."
</p>

<p>
He stopped for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Nancy," he said, turning to the girl, "it's so hard,
even now, to say good-bye to you."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, frightened by the thought of never
seeing him again, afraid of his never knowing that she
did love him.  Impossible wishes were in her heart,
impossible words on her tongue, for it seemed so wrong that
she should be offering herself only next month to a
stranger and parting without a word of endearment for
the friend, the lover, who filled the vivid horizon of this
morning walk.  This Western life and Western speech had
been playing havoc with all Nancy's conventions.  She was
on the point of confessing her love for Ronald, a disastrous
confession which could only complicate the unhappiness
of their friendship, for she had not changed and
would not change her intention of going back to her father
as she had said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we might as well be done with it," exclaimed
Ronald.  "It's no time for making speeches, is it?  You
know how I feel, Nancy.  I am not good at disguising my
feelings, but I do hope that, whatever comes of all this
mixup, you will be happy.  That, after all, is the important
thing."
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked away as though her eyes were intent upon
the sunlit boldness of the slope.  She was too well schooled
to betray emotion in the ordinary ways, by nervous play of
the hands, by shifting of the feet, but the tense posture
of her body suggested to observant eyes the strain she
was meeting; Ronald's eyes were too observant to be at
ease in watching her.  The man turned away.  The steadily
mounting splendor of the sun gave him courage.
</p>

<p>
"A priceless pair of fools we are," he said, suddenly,
"a priceless pair of fools, mooning like this on such a
splendid morning.  They'll be wondering if we're never
coming to breakfast.  Good-bye, Nancy."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and held it a moment.  The girl
thanked him with a grateful look for this brusque loyalty.
For the last most difficult time she was able, by his help,
to subdue the protesting voices of her blood.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Ronald," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
And so their parting was accomplished.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<p>
Nancy and Edward made a very different return from
their homecoming of a year before.  The girl would not
hear of her friends walking with her; farewells were so
painful that she wished to be finished with them, whatever
the cost to her feelings, and get what peace she could from
the dull melancholy of the journey in her chair.  There was
not much peace in the slow procession over the hills.  Her
eyes burned from weariness, her mind scanned discontentedly
every word she had spoken in the three crises of the
past twenty-four hours, yet suggested no better words in
their place.
</p>

<p>
Almost to her surprise, her father looked better and
stronger than he had seemed for months.  He greeted his
returned children with his old hearty affection.  Nancy
had feared to find him again in bondage to Kuei-lien;
if she had found the fogs of that evil spell clouding the
household, the daughter might well have turned her chair
round, given up the fight for her father, gone back to
Ronald.
</p>

<p>
But the great joy of her father in welcoming his children
made Nancy ashamed of these treacherous thoughts.  She
read in his face his own sacrifice, the self-control which
had kept him from forgetting his loneliness of a fortnight
by exploiting his passion for the concubine.  His restraint
had been more than human.  Only his love for his daughter,
the wish not to mar her last days by any shadow of
unhappiness, had held the man back from the delectable
oblivion in Kuei-lien's beauty.  He had spent many hours in
his study, had written characters and read dry books and
taken Li-an for long prattling walks, all the time wondering
what Nancy was doing, hoping that she would not
return, that she would yield to the persuasions he had
foreseen, yet counting off one by one the days of her visit and
dreading the one first act of disloyalty which might keep
her with the friends and lover from the West.
</p>

<p>
When the chairs were announced he did not know which
was uppermost, sorrow or joy, as he hastened to greet
the wanderers.  It was not his fault that Nancy had come
back.  The chance had been hers to escape.  It was not his
fault that they must fulfill the bond they had made.  It was
fate.  One cannot fight against the ordinances of fate.
He could only make the most of Nancy's last days at
home.
</p>

<p>
But Kuei-lien and Li-an saved the return from being
desolate.  They were so full of questions that they awoke
echoes of laughter in the household.  They embarked
Edward upon long tales and they set even the woebegone
amah bragging till she forgot the dreariness of being back
again in recounting the glories of the Ferris establishment,
glories, she let her hearers distinctly understand, such as
she had been bred to appreciate.  When she descanted upon
the cleanliness of the Ferris family, the unashamed use
of soap and water, the delicacy which did not tolerate dust
and cobwebs even in corners where they could not be seen,
the splendor of the dinner table set with linen and silver
and shining glasses, the manners and dress of the children,
the bathrooms, the bedrooms, the kitchen, the pantry, it
was only a step to her memories of Nancy's mother and
of stories she got new zest, fresh energy, to tell for the
hundredth time.
</p>

<p>
Nancy also lost part of her sadness in satisfying Kuei-lien's
curiosity about everything that had happened during
her stay&mdash;about everything except the things which
mattered.  She was clearer than her fulsome old nurse in
describing the picnics and games and swimming parties
and rebuilding before Kuei-lien's eyes every last detail of
the costumes she had worn.  Clothes intrigued the
concubine; they were a harmless topic for Nancy to enlarge
upon, indeed, kept her mind from graver regrets, so that
Kuei-lien became quite enchanted by extraordinary
surmises as to why the foreigner wasted good embroidery on
her chemise and hid satin ribbons where they could not be
seen, and cumbered herself, even at home, with the
superfluity of a skirt.
</p>

<p>
As a practical demonstration, Nancy consented to wear
a dress which Helen and Elizabeth between them had
given her.
</p>

<p>
"It's our gift of remembrance," Helen had said.
</p>

<p>
"And who knows if the time won't come when you will
want to give up being Chinese," added Elizabeth.  "You
will always have this ready."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien and Li-an led Nancy out, made her walk up
and down the path behind the temple, while they clapped
and laughed their applause at her unwonted appearance.
So excited were they that they never heard Herrick
approach, did not even guess his presence till he had stood
for some minutes dumbly watching his daughter.  When
they saw him they turned suddenly quiet.  Herrick gave
a little helpless toss of his head, then he called Nancy to
his room.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," he said, looking wonderingly at this
stranger of a daughter whom he felt&mdash;so curiously
changed was she by her Western garments&mdash;he had
never known before.
</p>

<p>
"I have been wondering," he began rather deliberately,
"why you asked to be married earlier.  The more I think
of it, the less I understand it.  What were you hiding
from me?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy groped vainly for the faintest suggestion of
an answer, but she could find no word to say.  She sat
mutely and helplessly on the edge of her uncomfortable
chair.
</p>

<p>
"Were you hiding anything from me?" the man pursued.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to tell my reasons," said Nancy
finally.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Nancy, you are a mystery to me.  I don't understand
a tenth of you.  I feel as though I had lost you.
Did you want to be married?"
</p>

<p>
The question was like an appeal for reassurance on
the part of her father, as if he wanted some support from
the girl to resist his own doubts.  Nancy did her gallant
best to comfort him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could believe you," he sighed, only half
convinced.
</p>

<p>
The ten days with his children away, his unexpected
fortitude in denying to his nerves Kuei-lien's lethal
comfort, had been a sacrifice he would have been wiser never
to have made.  There had been too much time to think.  And
Herrick had reached the state of body where thought was
a uselessly distracting exertion.  So long as his will shirked
the strain of mending what was not past cure, Nancy's
marriage, which had seemed such a reasonable match when
it was four safe years away, had become a sinister dream
he could not thrust from him.  The sight of Nancy in
her Western clothes made the pain unbearable.  He tried
to convince himself that he was not offering her up on
the altar of his folly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really want to be married?" he asked next,
not content with her previous answer.  "Do you understand
what it means?  You are so young.  Time goes so
fast."
</p>

<p>
"And if I don't want to be married," asked the girl,
with a look of curious insight into the hesitations of his
heart, "if I don't want to be married, will it make any
difference?"
</p>

<p>
This was the very question Herrick wished she had
not put.  It required such a definite answer.  To say "yes,"
to say that the marriage could be prevented at this eleventh
hour, meant an act Herrick did not have the courage to
perform so abruptly.  The issue would be nothing less than
throwing over the past thirteen years of his life.  After
so grave a breach of custom as the deliberate insult to
the t'ai-t'ai's family in stopping a marriage on the verge
of consummation, Chinese life would be impossible to
him.  The memory of Nancy's perjured troth would haunt
the rest of his days.  His only recourse would be to
return to the West he had disowned.  For his own sake,
Herrick dreaded the thought; for Nancy's sake, Herrick
groped for the strength of will to make the detestable
change.  But Nancy gave him no help.  She did not weep,
she did not shake his heart with sobs for pity, she did not
stimulate the sapped vigor of his courage.  At the
moment when his heart cried to his daughter, by the sight
of her uncontrolled weakness, by terror, misery, any
violent agony of passion, to make him be brave, she would
only put this candid question, which had to be answered
so definitely by yes or no.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it can't make any difference," he admitted
after a fearful pause, "things have gone so far."
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't really wish to be married at all," said
Nancy perversely.
</p>

<p>
Her father's raising a question which he himself now
confessed was not the least likely to have any practical
bearing upon her fate stirred up a sudden gust of anger,
till she was unready to leave him the comfort of thinking
she was happy.  But Herrick, far from accusing himself
of any fault, saw merely a freshly irritating symptom
of the waywardness which had vexed him several times
in the past.
</p>

<p>
"Why must you say that now?" he demanded.  "How
can I ever satisfy you when you ask for a thing at one
time and then, when it is too late, tell me you don't
want it?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't make any difference, anyway," said Nancy.
"I was just answering your question."
</p>

<p>
"It does make a difference, a tremendous difference,"
the father cried.  "Do you want me to throw over this
engagement, to tell the t'ai-t'ai you won't marry her
nephew, to bring everlasting disgrace on our heads?"
</p>

<p>
"No, we can't do that," replied Nancy, not permitting
herself time to toy with the notion.
</p>

<p>
"It would mean the end of our life in China," added
Herrick.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it would."
</p>

<p>
"And taking you and Edward home to England.  Would
you like that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to go to England.  I want to stay here."
</p>

<p>
"So you see how impossible it would be to change."
</p>

<p>
"Quite impossible," Nancy agreed.
</p>

<p>
Herrick looked at the girl narrowly.  He wondered if
she were mocking him.
</p>

<p>
"What did the Ferrises think of your marriage?" he
asked with a disconcerting shift in the direction of his
words.  "They didn't like it, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they didn't like it."
</p>

<p>
"Did they want you to be a foreigner?  Did they ask
you to stay with them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did they tell you that your father was a fool, that
he was ruining your life by his selfish schemes?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nancy, her loyalty shocked by the question.
</p>

<p>
"Then they were not as good friends as I had hoped
they might be," said the father bitterly.  "Ah, never mind
me," he continued, ashamed of the puzzled dismay he had
brought to Nancy's eyes.  "I am saying stupid things.  I
can't help it when I don't feel well.  Your marriage will
be quite all right, my child.  Of course you don't want to
be married.  What maiden does?  But it's nothing to
worry about.  It's not like going among foreigners and
having to learn new ways.  The Ferrises have seen you
only as a foreigner, just as you are now, and a pretty
English girl you do make, Nancy; even I have to admit
that."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the picture of his daughter in Western clothes
overpowered him; the mere mention of her appearance
opened the floodgates of his despair, released a torrent
of memories which rose higher and higher in his brain
till they threatened to drown out his life with their
unprisonable anguish.  Herrick stood up like a man in
great wrath; the veins of his forehead were swollen, his
eyes ablaze with the violence of this unexpected temper.
</p>

<p>
"Go away, Nancy," he ordered, "go and change those
wretched things!  You have bewitched me with this
masquerade.  How can I decide anything, give my right mind
to anything, when you sit mocking Me with the very
clothes you wear?"
</p>

<p>
By a gesture he seemed to sweep the frightened girl out
of his sight.
</p>

<p>
Only slowly, in the quiet of his room, did his muscles
relax and his heart cease pounding.  He wiped the sweat
from his forehead.  His hand was shaking.
</p>

<p>
"Why must I do these things?" he sighed.  "It was
not her fault."
</p>

<p>
His harshness had filled the house with silence.  He
rang his bell and to his surprise Kuei-lien appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anyone alive in this cursed place?" he asked.
"Can't you sing or shout or do something to make a noise?
Where have Edward and Li-an gone?  Have they lost
their tongues?"
</p>

<p>
"You have frightened them all," said Kuei-lien, with
an amused smile.  "You shouldn't speak so crossly to
your daughter.  She is weeping.  Her heart is not at peace."
</p>

<p>
"I don't need you to tell me that," Herrick retorted.
Then his voice softened.  "Where is she?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"In her room, naturally," was the tart rejoinder of the
concubine.  "Did you think she was so happy that she
would be out on the hills catching butterflies?"
</p>

<p>
"I will go and see her," said the father.
</p>

<p>
"Good, we'll all weep together."
</p>

<p>
Herrick paid no attention to this last impudence but
strode across the courtyard to the room where his daughter
was draining the bitterness of reaction which had
overflowed her heart after the sore tests she had been forced
to meet in such quick succession these last two days.  Even
in her bewilderment she had obeyed her father's wish and
was dressed again in Chinese clothes.  The discarded
Western finery lay in a pathetic heap upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," said the father, putting his hand gently on
her shoulder, "I am sorry.  I did not mean to speak so
angrily to you.  I did not want to make you so unhappy."
</p>

<p>
Not for years had he said such words as these.  Long
ago he had lost the habit of making an apology.  He had
played the part of the all-sufficing tyrant who does not
expect his acts to be questioned.  But Nancy's distress, the
sight of her wish to please him even by unreasonable
obedience, struck deep beneath every artifice of manner,
making him utter his words of contrition as genuinely as
though he had not laid aside such language thirteen years
back.  At the sound of his voice Nancy pulled herself up
and faced him with tear-stained eyes.  She did not know
how to answer her father's strange words.
</p>

<p>
"You are not to blame for making me angry," the father
went on, carried beyond measure along the path of genuineness
by the sorrow Nancy's face revealed, "it was my fault.
I could not bear that glimpse of you in the Western dress
you ought to have been wearing all your life.  It reminded
me too unspeakably of how I have cheated you.  It made
me realize how I have robbed your mother's daughter,
Nancy, merely to follow selfish dreams of my own.  All
these years, my child&mdash;they have been a mistake, and I
can never make them up to you."
</p>

<p>
The girl was still speechless, her grief forgotten in this
immense unveiling of her father's heart.
</p>

<p>
"But I can stop one thing," he vowed, "I can make up
one mistake, I can stop the folly of this marriage.  You
are young and I am old.  You have your whole life before
you.  I have&mdash;nothing.  It doesn't matter what becomes
of me.  I am going back to Peking to-morrow to tell the
t'ai-t'ai that I am done with these schemes&mdash;my heart
was never in them&mdash;I am not going to sacrifice my only
daughter&mdash;for you are the only daughter I have been able
to care about&mdash;I am not going to sacrifice my only daughter
just to pile up the ruins of my own wasted life.  After
that&mdash;well, it doesn't matter what comes after that.  I
suppose I can dodder along in a frock coat and a silk hat
till you find the one man who will love you better and care
for you.  Then one old man less in the world won't matter."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's quick sympathy rushed to raise her father from
this unseemly abasement, to prove to him that he had not
sacrificed her, that he had not done wrong, not made ruin
of his life or of hers.  How would he survive, she
wondered, when all that he had delighted in was swept away?
How could she ask him, at his time of life, to make these
new beginnings for her?  The blind love which had been too
strong for Ronald's arguments, for the indignant
persuasiveness of the twins, would not let her give way even
before the appeal of her father himself; for she felt that
he was pleading against himself.  She had never known
him outside the comforts of his Chinese home, the graceful
amenities in which her own pride helped her to compass
his.  To make him an exile from these, from the
spacious mode of living which she thought of as the very
marrow of his bones, the tissue of his flesh, that was a
fate she was not willing, cost what it might, to bring upon
him.  Her own dread of the West and its alien customs
made her shrink still more sensitively from dragging her
father out of the peace of a home which ought to be the
shelter of his failing years.
</p>

<p>
"I would be unhappy all my life, if you did this," she
said.  "What right have I to hear my father saying such
things?  How can we break the promise we have made and
not be ashamed forever after?  No matter where you took
me, my heart would not be at peace, for I should remember
that my willfulness had destroyed my father's good name.
'Shall I follow the desires of my ears and eyes and bring
my parents to disgrace?'  Please don't remember my foolish
words," she begged.  "I don't want to go to the West
among strangers.  What do I know about foreign customs?
My father gives too much weight to my mischievous idle
words.  I was only wearing foreign clothes to amuse Kuei-lien
and Li-an.  I will never wear them again.  I did not
mean to trouble my father or to make him think I was
unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"Are you telling me the truth?" demanded Herrick,
already alarmed by the largeness of the renunciation he
had proposed.
</p>

<p>
"I am telling the truth," replied Nancy, with her eyes
cast down.
</p>

<p>
"But you just said you didn't really want to be married."
</p>

<p>
There was a flush in her cheeks, a faint smile on her
lips.
</p>

<p>
"What maiden ever really wanted to be married?" she
asked.  "If you offered me all the men in the world I
should say the same thing."  There was a pause.  "I say
many, many things," she went on softly, "and sometimes
my words fight against each other.  You have made me so
happy, you have given me so many good things, that I
could not but be sad to go out from the home of my
father, even if I were called to the halls of the palace
itself.  But ah, my father, you know that your will is
mine.  The tree cannot be torn up to give light to the
sapling.  I am not so ignorant, not so self-willed, as not
to know that 'to look upon obedience as right is the law
for women.'  I learned that long ago.  In a thousand ten
thousand of years I won't forget it."
</p>

<p>
Herrick was strangely moved by this grave eloquence
from the lips of his child.
</p>

<p>
"You are wiser than you ought to be," he murmured;
"there is not a man on this earth fit to marry you.  I don't
know whether I am brave or a coward in letting you go.
You will miss me, Nancy, but oh, how I shall miss you!
Sometimes I wish you weren't flesh and blood, but were
like the rustling of the autumn leaves in the locust trees;
then I could always have you and no one would envy me."
</p>

<p>
"The locust trees lose their leaves," said the girl quietly;
the poem recurred again like a persistent undercurrent to
her thoughts:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In a morning the spring is finished, the crimson colors are old&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Yes, they do," admitted Herrick; "we are foolish to
take our little plans so seriously.  It would be better if we
were enjoying to-day instead of weeping over to-morrow.
I have been weak, fickle, changeable, Nancy, and I have
tried to blame you, tried to put the burden upon you.  Here
I have even been so irresolute as to hand over my will for
you to direct.  That was a thing no father should ask of
his daughter.  After all, what does it matter how much
trust we put into our paltry schemes, what is the use of
vexing ourselves, when the stars, whether we like it or not,
decide our lives for us?  You were right: autumn leaves
do fall.  I shan't remember you in them.  I shall remember
you in the stars, which give you your heart's quietness
because you obey them.  They don't change and grow old,
they and the sun and the moon&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the sun and the moon," echoed Nancy.
</p>

<p>
Then the world went black before her eyes.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
</h3>

<p>
The seventh moon waxed and waned in a succession of
trivial days.  The interest of the summer, so far as Nancy
was concerned, had ended with her triple battle waged
against Ronald and the twins and her father.  Chatter
with Kuei-lien, perfunctory excursions with a wary eye
lest she blunder into Ronald, whom she did not trust herself
to meet again, filled in the tale of days.  There was
but one high moment, the Feast of Souls, when she and
Edward secretly sacrificed to the spirit-tablet of their
mother.  Theirs was a fervid little cult which had grown up
unmentioned except between themselves, a worship of the
alien mother whom only Nancy dimly remembered.  It
signalized the bond which had always kept them from
feeling quite kin to the rest of their father's family, an
aloofness of origin which centred naturally round the
legend of their mother.
</p>

<p>
Guided by reticence quite unusual to the communal life
of the household, they had never been willing to drag
their secret into the open gossip of the courtyards, but
kept up this worship as an act and a habit too sacred
to be divulged, too far apart from the noisy ostentation
of the sacrifices which the women from time to time
offered.  Their shrine was holy ground, and when they made
their sober childish prayers before the gilded tablet, the
boy and girl, so shyly, fondly devoted to each other,
seemed orphans indeed, shut out from the world around
them by their still tenser devotion to the mother who was
little more than a memory and a shadow.
</p>

<p>
Their worship this year was also, on Nancy's part, a
farewell.  She was saying good-bye to the spirit of her
mother, whom she would not be entitled to worship next
summer when the festival of All Souls once more quickened
love and regret for the dead.  For she must give up
her own forefathers, give up even her mother, when she
went out from home to the strange halls of her husband.
Thenceforth his ancestors would be hers, and in place of
the dearly loved tablet which she and Edward had fashioned
so loyally between themselves, she must bow her
head before a row of cold names which were not even
dead to her because they never had been alive.
</p>

<p>
With grave seriousness she bequeathed the trust to
Edward, envying him his right to worship his mother
undisturbed until the end of his days.  So passed the Feast
of Souls, and one by one the days of the ghostly seventh
moon slipped away.
</p>

<p>
Tedious, Nancy found them, for she was very much
alone.  She dodged close talk with her father, an attitude
for which he was grateful, because neither he nor his
daughter wished to touch again upon matters which in an
incomplete, unspoken way they had left settled.  The father
stayed drowsily with his books, slept and dozed through
the afternoons, realizing with taciturn dismay the fact
that he was old and that his thoughts were empty of
comfort.  He tried some walking, but his heart complained.
Undue exercise taxed his strength, sent the blood to
his head.  One thing he had set his will not to do: to give
way to Kuei-lien's enchantment&mdash;not till his daughter was
married.  This was a promise he had made silently with
himself, a little way of being fair to Nancy, and he stuck
heroically to his agreement, although there were moments
when the vacancy of the books over which he nodded made
this ascetic life almost too tiresome to be borne.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you, Nancy," Kuei-lien said more
than once, enjoying the comfortable sleepiness of the
afternoons in Nancy's room.  Her fear of the t'ai-t'ai had been
growing less and her sympathy with the betrothed girl
more.  "I am not so blind as you think I am.  This
marriage is your making; I can see that, but I can't see why."
</p>

<p>
"One has to be married," was Nancy's usual defense,
when the subject was forced upon her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but why this particular marriage, when your
father has given you so many opportunities to get out of it?
You are not one of us, Nancy, even though you believe
you are.  Your father would have liked it best if you had
stayed with your foreign friends."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien, from her talks with the amah, knew more
than the girl dreamed of the pressure the Ferrises had
brought to keep their guest.  In idle moments she could not
help toying with the last year's plan.
</p>

<p>
"That is finished," said Nancy decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"If I had been your father's daughter," laughed the
concubine, "I should have managed things much better.
Your father would give every cent he has promised the
t'ai-t'ai to be rid of this match.  Why don't you fall sick
or cut off your hair so that you have to become a nun?
Then you would save everybody's face.  Even the t'ai-t'ai
would be satisfied, if she got her money&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She will get her money, whatever it is, in the way we
have promised," announced the girl.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you are holding the old woman to her bargain
just to spite her," vowed Kuei-lien.  "You know her
whole family is afraid of the daughter-in-law they are
getting.  If it weren't that they had been bribed by your
dowry, they would just as soon marry their priceless son
to a fox-spirit.  They will think it a miracle if you don't
bear him four-legged sons; it will be a miracle with such
a donkey for their father!  What are you going to
do when you go to them?  Are you going to play handmaid
to your father-in-law's water pipe and sew out your eyes
on underwear that is greasy from your mother-in-law's
unwashed body?"
</p>

<p>
Against her own conscience Nancy was amused by the
racy way Kuei-lien dealt with topics that were held to
be sacred.  She knew quite well that the parents of her
husband were not proper game for these irreverent shots, yet
she relished every impudent hit at their expense.  It was
one way of settling scores for the travail these unknown
personages had given her.  She was in a mood, as Kuei-lien
perceived, to be spiteful.  And she was curious to get
every chance inkling of what her life was to be.
</p>

<p>
"And when you meet them in the morning, will you
invite their 'jade toes graciously to approach'?  If you do,
Nancy, if you jump to fill the teapot and wait up late to
put your old grandmother to bed, you will be lost, you will
be their slave for the rest of your days.  I know these
small-livered people.  They will live to a hundred just for
the pleasure of bullying you, just to let you dust out every
wrinkle of their sagging faces.  If you have a daughter,
it will be your fault because she isn't a son; if you have
a son, it will be your meanness of heart that kept him
from being twins.  Faugh! the stupidity of having babies
so that other people can cackle as if they were the hen
that dropped the egg!  I don't hold with these old-fashioned
notions.  I am a new Chinese, newer than you with all
your foreign blood.  And heaven help you if you have a
white-haired brat!"
</p>

<p>
She said these unspeakable things so wickedly that
Nancy could not keep from laughing.  The betrothed
girl watched the scornful twist of the lips by which the
concubine expressed more aptly even than by words her
pouting contempt for the Chous and all their clan.
Kuei-lien's odd turns of sarcasm were pleasant to hear.  The
warm afternoon imparted its sense of lazy security even
from the family to which she was promised.  Nancy gazed
with easy pleasure at her own white knees as she sat, half
clothed, on the bed.  She clasped her arms tightly round
them and rubbed the soft skin with her cheeks, feeling
almost as lazily content with summer and sunlight as
she used to be in her more careless child days.
</p>

<p>
"What did Mencius say?" demanded Kuei-lien, continuing
her tirade.  "'At the marriage of a young woman,
her mother admonishes her, accompanying her to the door
on her leaving, and cautioning her with these words:
You're going to your home.  You must be respectful;
you must be careful; do not disobey your husband.'  Hm-m,
I suppose your worthy old teacher put circles next to
those characters, didn't he?  He would.  And what did
the father say to his son?  He 'admonished' him.  That was
all.  The Sage didn't explain that part of it.  The Sage
was a man.  I don't believe in sages."
</p>

<p>
Nothing was sacred to Kuei-lien in her mocking moods.
She had never let Herrick be sacred even to himself.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in sages.  I don't believe in nuns.  I
don't believe in priests.  I don't believe in gods.  And I
don't believe in being respectful to a husband.  You haven't
a mother, Nancy; I'll be your mother.  I will admonish
you, I will accompany you to the door when you leave, I
will caution you.  Yes, indeed, you are going to your home.
Very well, let them know from the first that it is your
home and that you are not grateful merely for a place near
the k'ang, like the chickens that peck rice off the floor.
Remember, you will have the family purse in your hands,
but only because they'll want you to produce twice the
money that's in it, find cash for your father-in-law's
opium and your mother-in-law's mah-jongg debts, and
board and lodging for their third and fourth and fifth
cousins and for all the children they can squeeze without
cost under your roof.  Stop that from the beginning; be
as niggardly as they would be in your place.  They will
hate you, anyway, because you're a foreigner and because
you're different and because they'll think if only they
could have been bribed into taking your money without
your precious self they might have secured a Yang kuei-fei
in your stead.  So you might as well give them good reason
for hating you and, better still, for fearing you.  Then,
when you've scolded them till their ears are like wax and
made them shake in their slippers every time they see your
shadow crossing the courtyard, they will be only too happy
to let you go back to your father, to the moon if you wish;
they will press upon you the need for a long vacation
and, while you're safely out of the way, they will find
another wife, a nice quiet-tempered girl, for your husband,
who can bear a dozen children and choke the house with
the dust from her broom and pick bugs with nimble
finger nails from the seams of the quilt in which your
illustrious parents-in-law have been pleased to sleep for
four thousand sweaty nights."
</p>

<p>
Nancy held up her hands in protest, but Kuei-lien
laughed at her qualms.
</p>

<p>
"You can do it so easily," she said; "they will expect
nothing better from you because you are a foreigner.
Anything you do will be only what they expected.  If
only you browbeat them from the beginning, before they
have got breath enough to browbeat you, then you will
have your own way.  You can go back to your father's and
stay for sixty years and they will not be sorry; they will
bless the spirits of their ancestors for having delivered
them after their own folly in bringing a devil and a
termagant into their midst.  Aren't my words true?  You
will be happy, they will be happy, your father will be
happy; everyone will be happy except the unlucky girl who
takes your place.  You can trust them to take revenge on
her for all the injuries they have suffered from you.  I
don't envy her the time she'll have of it.  But that's not
your fault.  Better somebody else miserable than poor
me: that's the way to look at the foolishness of this
world."
</p>

<p>
Many letters had been coming from the t'ai-t'ai, urging
her husband to bring Nancy back to Peking.  There were
so many things to be done: the bridal furniture had to be
sent, the wedding dress cut, the gifts procured.  But
Herrick refused to budge till the time he had set.  With the
coming of the eighth moon he could no longer postpone the
claims of his wife.  He roused himself unwillingly from
this torpor of indecision and packed his reluctant family
back to Peking.  He had waited upon fate as long as he
could, but fate offered him no help.
</p>

<p>
With their arrival in Peking, the t'ai-t'ai took vigorous
command of the household.  The momentum of her energy
carried everyone before her, most of all Nancy, who had
no further time to hesitate and reflect.  The ensuing days
became almost a round of processions, for Herrick had
allowed barely time enough for the festivities which had
to be crowded into twenty-four days.  The courtyards
never seemed clear of the smoke of firecrackers, the
neighbors were always being called to their doors by the lilt
of wind instruments.  First came the wedding cakes, and
the satin for the bridal dress, and elaborate gifts, which
the t'ai-t'ai took care to return more elaborately.
</p>

<p>
It had been necessary to transport her brother and the
important members of his family to Peking, to take for
them a house in the capital, since Herrick had stood out
obstinately against sending his daughter to be married in
the ancestral home of the bridegroom.  The t'ai-t'ai
grumbled, of course; she grudged the expense which she
said her brother could not afford, she moaned about the
insult to her old mother who was much too feeble to make
the long journey to Peking to see her grandson married.
But Herrick said never to mind the expense; he would
see that they were not out of purse because of this
accommodation.  With so liberal a promise, the t'ai-t'ai decided
she could meet his wishes and she took care not only that
Herrick should pay for moving Nancy's husband to Peking
but that many of the showy presents, which were paraded
through the streets on their way to the home of the bride,
were actually gifts from Herrick to himself.  Her thrift
preserved Nancy's dowry intact from all the corroding
expense of the wedding.
</p>

<p>
The autumn festival dawned, but its rejoicings were only
an incident, compared with the greater day hurrying upon
its heels.  Nancy said quiet farewell to the full moon,
climbing once again into her comfortable old pine tree to
watch its splendor as the moon mounted.  She turned a
grave face to its light; it was not only a symbol of her sex,
of her womanliness, the symbol which she had learned to
revere from childhood, but it was bound by deeper ties to
the inmost thoughts of her heart, so deeply bound that she
almost looked for a miracle to be done in her behalf and
this crowning moon of her life never to wane from its
completed beauty.  But it waned.
</p>

<p>
The rest was a dull trance in which the days went by,
scarcely counted.  Night after night the moon decreased;
the girl's spirits fell.  She kept tryst each evening with its
rising until it rose too late to be awaited.  Then the
darkness frightened her.
</p>

<p>
In fear she gave herself up to the will of her stepmother
and submitted without words to being taught the
ceremonies of her wedding, to being set up like a doll for
the fitting of the bridal garments.  Despite Kuei-lien's
laughing advice, she remained remote and aloof, the
seething bustle of the household eddying unheeded round her
body, which was the only part that her eyes gave them the
feeling they could claim.  Where her thoughts were no
one could tell, no one indeed had the curiosity to search
out except Kuei-lien, whose spirit of irony was amused
by the puzzle of the silent girl.
</p>

<p>
The bridal furniture had been got ready.  Three days
before the wedding it was sent off.
</p>

<p>
Great show was made of the chairs and tables for the
bridal chamber, the chairs with their carved arms and
round panels of gray Yunnan marble, but, most sumptuous
of all, the bridal bed, hung so heavily with curtains of
scarlet satin that the wealth of embroidery led the eyes
astray from the pictures inlaid in the woodwork and
even from the silver chains which drew the curtains aside.
Kuei-lien's tongue was rife with jests about this bed and
its heap of satin quilts.  Nancy hid her burning cheeks for
shame at the concubine's unsparing frankness.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, that's nothing to be afraid of," declared Kuei-lien.
"You can be mistress there, even if you are the bride.
Your husband will be more frightened than you to be shut
up with a strange woman, and a foreigner at that, behind
those happy curtains.  They will fill him full of wine to
make him brave.  He's only a boy, nothing to shrink
from or blush about.  Marriage is marriage and a bridal
bed is a bridal bed; it is foolish pretending to be so delicate
about things that have to be.  You are lucky to have rich
curtains and plenty of warm quilts and one place where
your mother-in-law can't trouble you.  You don't have to
make your bed your profession like me."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien's bitter moods, her uneasy habit of thinking
too deeply, made her singularly outspoken, but Nancy
refused to listen further.  Her only peace was to be carried
on as in a dream.  She could not bear to stare at her fate
set forth in these visible pictures.
</p>

<p>
The bedstead, the chairs, the boxes all went their festive
way to her new home, where soothsayers ensured the
fortunate placing of the bed.  Her father's house was
draped with red, the walls were hung with scarlet banners
on which "joy" was repeated in huge characters of gilt,
characters written double to amplify the luck of the
occasion.  The courtyards were roofed with red bunting and the
first chrysanthemums of the season banked high against
the walls.  Into the nightly feasting Nancy did not intrude,
and her father did not appear, did not trust himself to
see Nancy.  He was ill, feeble, uncomforted by the bustle
which echoed even into his silent room.
</p>

<p>
For the last evening a great feast was prepared and
though only the women of the household and their kinsfolk
took part, Herrick having no outside guests to invite,
they made the most of their one great chance to be merry
over an event which promised no good fortune to any of
their number.  It was the t'ai-t'ai's affair, this wedding,
but that was no reason for declining the baked meats of
their enemy's bounty.  So they were quite cheerful and
quite eager to see the girl who had lived with them, so
aloof and yet so intimate, clothed at last in her bridal
garments.
</p>

<p>
In her last afternoon the t'ai-t'ai came to Nancy's room
to tell her stepdaughter it was time.  Everything was
prepared.  She now needed only to put up her hair and put
on her dress for the ceremonial farewell to her own family
and then retire to the night's vigil of weeping and vain
efforts at sleep, weeping and sleeping both rigidly
prescribed by custom, before the bridal chair was heralded
by trumpets in the morning.  Kuei-lien came in behind the
t'ai-t'ai; Li-an and a maid followed her.  They had brought
the clothes which the bride was now formally to try on to
make sure that all was ready for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
Nancy rose without comment and was as quiet as a
puppet in their hands, raising her arms or turning her head
at their bidding.  A square of red carpet was laid on the
floor for her to stand upon.  Slowly and with great
deliberation Kuei-lien and her helpers proceeded to their work,
the dignity of the season making them linger over each
detail.  The girl was divested of her own garments, bathed
and scented, and the cotton of her former undergarments
replaced by linen on which symbols of good luck had been
embroidered in cross-stitch.  The t'ai-t'ai exclaimed upon
the pity of Nancy's unbound feet and deplored the new
custom of large feet, which would ruin China, she vowed,
but Kuei-lien defended new fashions at the expense of old,
while the girl who was the subject of their debate gave no
signs of listening, but allowed her body to be assessed
without reply.  Sometimes she watched the fingers that were
busy with her; for the most part she kept her fixed gaze
upon the carpet.  A panel of cloth was tied with strings
round her waist and hung by a silver chain from her neck.
Stockings of scarlet silk were pulled up to her knees.  She
stepped unresistingly into the undermost pair of long
pantaloons and let the tunic that matched them be slipped softly
down her arms.  Then, at the precise minute the soothsayers
had set, began the unbraiding of her thick hair, the
sign that she was to be a maiden no more; slowly it was
soaked with resin, pulled across her head till it matched the
smoothness of enamel, and gathered in a lustrous clump at
the back, a clump into which Kuei-lien thrust blade-like
pins of soft gold.  The fringe of down round her forehead
would not be pulled out till she came to her new
home.
</p>

<p>
The concubine and her helpers stood back to admire
the change they had made.  Then over the face of the
bride they dusted clouds of powder, and brushed it half
away again before they softened the spectral white with
an artfully applied surface of rouge.  Nancy seemed to
cease breathing while they reddened her lips; she closed
her eyes while they penciled the graceful arch of the
brows.  Her face had become like the mask of a tragic
figure, something removed from life, yet deeply instilled
with the most pitiful passions of life, austere and delicate,
sombre and youthful, possessed of a beauty which a day
could destroy, yet which promised in its singularly immobile
pose to live forever, an unforgettable memory.  Nancy
had lost her personality; she had become a symbol.  The
age-old traditions of the bridal took her out of common
places and common scenes, they invested her with sadness
and fear, made her too holy to be touched, too lovely to be
worshiped, set upon her face the pathetic seal of flowers
at their blossoming.
</p>

<p>
Even the scoffing spirit of Kuei-lien was awed by her
handiwork.  With a caressing touch the concubine
proceeded to her task, helping Nancy into the voluminous
scarlet folds of her skirt, fastening the gold buttons of her
scarlet tunic, slipping bangles over her wrists and setting
gently on her glossy hair the headdress of pearls.  There
now remained only the veil of red silk to be placed over
her face before she entered the chair.  For the rest, Nancy
was the bride complete, and Kuei-lien, in an unwonted
mood of reverence, could not resist bowing before the
brilliant vision.
</p>

<p>
Dusk had come.  Hours had gone by.  Nancy came forth,
assisted by Kuei-lien, to take farewell of the family among
whom she had lived so long and so happily.  The all-provident
t'ai-t'ai had made ready an altar with a bright
new tablet to Nancy's unrecorded ancestors.  In the first
grayness of twilight the red candles glowed in their pewter
sticks, the incense went up in faint spirals, the courtyard
was redolent of burning sandalwood.  The women stood
round, hushed by a spirit of awe close to tears, when the
bride bowed gravely in front of the glittering tablet,
separating herself by this simple act from the host of spirits
whose name she had borne.  With the same trance-like
dignity Nancy bowed to the t'ai-t'ai.  Then she let herself
be led to her father, who was too ill, too sad to receive her
worship before the eyes of the feasters.  The door was
opened and she was allowed to go in alone.  She stood
motionless before her father.
</p>

<p>
Timothy Herrick stared as though his mind scarcely
could believe what his eyes saw.  He seemed struggling to
realize that this vision of scarlet and gold was his daughter,
come at last to say good-bye.  For the first time in the long
tedium of the day's events, Nancy lifted up her eyes.  She
paid her whole debt of loyalty with that one look and then,
behind the tragic splendor of her dress, behind the
loveliness of brocades that outshone the blood-red lustre of
flames, her spirit seemed to withdraw, as though she had
said good-bye.  Nancy became only a memory in the sight
of her father.
</p>

<p>
The man trembled with a great moan of despair, scarlet
and gold blinded his eyes; suddenly, with a cry that rasped
in his throat, Herrick threw himself forward, buried his
head in his arms, and so lay still amid the vain litter of
his desk.
</p>

<p>
Nancy waited for him to speak, quite forgetting it was
her time to kneel and bow.  Finally, when the silence
seemed hopeless, when the clock had ticked away many
empty minutes, and still with no sign from her father,
she realized that someone was leading her away again, that
Kuei-lien was leading her back to her own room.  She had
left the presence of her father without the kindness of
one last word.  There had been so much to say, so much
she wanted to tell him; yet her heart had been sapped of
emotion till the girl was not even sorry for this wordless
parting.
</p>

<p>
Only one thing could have wakened her spirit, and this
she did not know.  She had been too tired to see that not
she, but her father, had been the first to go out from his
home.

CHAPTER XXVII
</h3>

<p>
Into her own room the noise of the feasters could not
penetrate.  The red candles burned with a steady gleam.
</p>

<p>
"I think I shall take this room when you are gone,"
said Kuei-lien; "it is quieter than mine."
</p>

<p>
There was a light tap on the door.
</p>

<p>
"I must leave you now," announced the concubine,
in the same teasing voice; "it is time for you to weep.
You must weep, you know.  All brides are supposed to
weep.  Your ancestors will be angry if they see you
showing no signs of sadness at leaving them.  We shall all
measure your affection for us by the noise you make.
Your father will be listening with a watch in his hand.  But,
however much you wail, don't spoil your dress.  I shall be
back soon to undress you so that it will be fresh for the
morning."
</p>

<p>
The tap on the door was repeated.  Kuei-lien stepped
gingerly round the red carpet and went softly out of the
room.  To her surprise she found the t'ai-t'ai waiting
outside.  Despite the dim light she could see deep agitation
in the woman's face; she followed without any sound into
her own room.  The t'ai-t'ai looked to make sure the door
was fastened; her attention was strained as though she
suspected the walls of bending down to catch her words.
</p>

<p>
"The Great Man is dead," she said in a voice almost
too low for Kuei-lien to hear.
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed the girl.  "Dead?  It can't be.  It is
not true.  How can he be dead?  We have only just come
from his room."
</p>

<p>
"I found him dead.  He was lying with his head across
his desk."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien considered the sentence for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so he was," she admitted.
</p>

<p>
"I could not move him," went on the t'ai-t'ai.  "His life
must have gone out like that."  She clicked her tongue.
"I knew he was dead when I touched him.  Ah, what a
time to die, what a time to die!"
</p>

<p>
This last exclamation brought back to Kuei-lien the
needs of the moment.  The possibilities of her own future
were too immense to be considered now; they were like
disordered fragments strewn across the floor of her brain,
baffling her as to how to begin sorting them, and so there
was respite from her own peril diverting her thoughts
to the problem of Nancy's wedding.  That at least was less
disturbing than the prospect of what might happen to her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose this must postpone the marriage," she
said, trying to see what was in the mind of her mistress;
"at least it delays it for the hundred days, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"But we can't postpone the marriage," moaned the
woman; "the money hasn't been paid."
</p>

<p>
"The money hasn't been paid?" asked Kuei-lien incredulously.
"But we shall have no face at all if we go on
with a wedding when the master is dead in the house.
That would be impossible.  We are not coolies.  What
would men say?"
</p>

<p>
"We must go on with it," persisted the t'ai-t'ai.  Then
she grew more secretive.  "No one knows he is dead,
unless it be Nancy.  He must have died while she was
there.  What was she doing when you went in?"
</p>

<p>
"Just standing there, looking at her feet."
</p>

<p>
"You were outside all the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What did you hear?  Did the girl do anything or say
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"She did nothing, I am sure of that.  She just stood,
waiting for him to speak.  She might have stood all night;
she's like that.  She didn't know he never would speak
again.  Finally I grew tired and pushed the door open.
And there he was, with his head on the table"&mdash;Kuei-lien
could not help shivering at the memory&mdash;"and she
was staring at the floor.  I couldn't see any more use in her
doing that&mdash;ai, it was more useless than I thought!  I
took her hand and brought her out again."
</p>

<p>
"Then she can't have guessed that he was dead,"
exclaimed the t'ai-t'ai with a gasp of relief.  "She surely
would have cried out.  She can't have guessed, she
certainly can't have guessed.  You must go back to her and
see that she doesn't get some crazy impulse, some crazy
notion of running back to her father's room to say good-bye.
I am never sure of what she may do next.  It is never
safe to trust her.  If she doesn't know, then we are all
right.  What good would it do to tell her now?  She will
learn quickly enough."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she will&mdash;poor child," Kuei-lien said.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use telling anyone till she's safely away in her
chair.  I have locked his door.  What time does she go?"
</p>

<p>
"At seven; the chair will be here about six."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  It's only for a night.  After she's gone it won't
matter if we find out that the Great Man is dead.  It will
be too late to stop the wedding.  But it mustn't be known
to-night.  That would just make matters difficult for all of
us and wouldn't do him any good.  Aren't we carrying out
his own wishes?  And who knows what that girl might do
if we postponed the wedding?  With her father gone,
there's not a soul in the house can control that stubborn
will of hers.  You go back to her and I'll see that he isn't
disturbed."
</p>

<p>
"They would have to make a lot of noise to disturb
him now," Kuei-lien said.
</p>

<p>
She found Nancy sitting stiffly, gazing with dry eyes at
the candles.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you wept?" she asked, with a gesture of playful
reproof.  "Ah, but never mind, Nancy, you will weep!"
</p>

<p>
The bride still persisted in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Nancy," Kuei-lien urged, "you must talk; you
must say something.  I haven't heard you say a word
to-day.  What are you thinking about?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not thinking," answered Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"What a perfect nun you would make," laughed the
concubine.  "I wish I could stop thinking.  But it's no
use, my dear, practising these nunnery manners for the
bridal bed.  And even if you don't want to think, you
ought to talk.  There is nothing better than talk when your
heart is in pain.  Lots of talk, never mind what it's about,
as long as it keeps your mind from thinking.  I have had to
talk for years, Nancy.  I have had to make myself talk.
You will too.  You are only just beginning to know what
life is."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien was treating herself richly to her own medicine.
In the last few weeks her manner toward Nancy had
been growing increasingly kinder till she found herself
bearing Nancy's pain with her own.  To-night, in this still
room, the secret that lay between herself and the girl she
was tending overpowered her veins with a surging pity
so that she chattered desperately to hold back the
recurring treacherous need to break down and weep.
</p>

<p>
With an understanding gentleness she removed one by
one Nancy's brilliant garments while the girl submitted
as obediently as a child.  Nancy's splendor slipped from
her like autumn leaves blown down by a wind, leaving her
white and solitary and helpless.
</p>

<p>
"You are beautiful, Nancy," said Kuei-lien, unconsciously
echoing Elizabeth's tribute of long ago.  Yet she
could not resist teasing the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Your husband will have to do this for you to-morrow
night.  They will make him drunk, I expect, to give him
courage.  But his hands won't be so gentle as mine.  Yes,
Nancy, you will miss even me."
</p>

<p>
Her sympathy, however, would not let her prod the
wound she had made.  Kuei-lien's heart was sad, for
Nancy's sake and her own.  She began humming a little
song as she worked:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Leaves like scarlet rain in the air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves like scarlet dew on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheeling to the earth with no sound,<br>
  Leaving high branches gray and bare."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She took off Nancy's gay slippers with the whimsical
thought that her hands were the destroying wind.  But her
tongue could not cease humming:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yellow leaves strew down golden snow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow leaves golden on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making hearts forlorn with their sound,<br>
  Naked branches cold when they go."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What shall I do when I don't have you to sing to,
Nancy?" she asked, as she took off the bright bangles
from the arms of the bride.
</p>

<p>
"You will have my father to sing to," Nancy answered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I shall have your father to sing to."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien almost wept.  She tried hurriedly to hide her
confusion in more words of her song:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Swift the summer sun in his day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift the autumn moon in her night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow the winter frost with its blight,<br>
  Trampling golden leaves from its way."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She stood up to lift off Nancy's headdress of pearls.
Then she put them on again, and stood back to admire their
sinuous lustre against the dark hair of the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, a bride can never be so beautiful to another as she
is beautiful to herself," she sighed.
</p>

<p>
And yet, she thought, these jewels were the last sight
Timothy Herrick had seen on earth.  No wonder he
covered his eyes so that he might take their loveliness with
him into the grave.  She covered her own eyes to keep
back the tears.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Gold youth, scarlet love, each must fade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon and stars cease shining in the night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter snows shall long glimmer white,<br>
  Scarlet leaves and gold low are laid."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She went softly to the girl and lifted off the pearls like
a crown.
</p>

<p>
"And now," she said, "you must sleep."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
</h3>

<p>
The noise of crackers broke into the first light of the day.
Nancy woke, scarcely understanding where she was or that
this was her bridal day.  She had not expected to sleep.
Kuei-lien had withdrawn, leaving her lying open-eyed on
her bed.  She had watched the tranquil candles which even
now still flickered, low and gutted though they were.  Her
heart had been dumb with uneasiness.  She could not drive
from her mind the thought that she had something to say
to her father and that now it was too late to say it.  Three
or four times she had been on the point of stealing through
the quiet house to see him, to revive for the last time those
moments of infinite tenderness when he had seemed to
know, without her telling, every secret of her heart.  But
she was afraid, and, before she realized it, had fallen into
a sleep so troubled that it was like being awake.  Now came
the burst of firecrackers and the weird sound of the pipes.
Kuei-lien came bustling into the room.
</p>

<p>
"It is time to be up, Nancy," she called cheerfully,
"the bridal chair has come."
</p>

<p>
Then with the help of Li-an and the maidservant began
the solemn ritual they had made trial of yesterday, the
clothing of the bride.  But none of them could recapture
yesterday's deep feeling.  In the chill light the bride
emerged, looking tired and sleepy, much too pale for the
richness of her dress.  She pretended to eat the breakfast
which was offered her and waited calmly for the proper
moment to cross the courtyard to the hall where the chair
had been set.  At last the t'ai-t'ai appeared with her niece,
who had come to fetch the bride.  The flutes began once
again their unvarying tune.  Men with sashes across the
shoulders threw down squares of red carpet under her feet
and picked them up again behind her as she walked slowly
from her room to the great reception hall.  Kuei-lien and
the t'ai-t'ai's newly arrived niece supported her, each
holding an arm.  The air was blue with the smoke of the
crackers.
</p>

<p>
The hallway seemed dim after the courtyard.  The lanterns
were swathed in red silk.  The candles on the gleaming
altar were choked with clouds of incense.  Nancy
was so dazed by the smoke and the noise that she did not
see at first the chair with its trappings of gold and green
and purple and blue heavily embroidered on the scarlet
satin; she raised her eyes for one swift glance at its
gorgeous canopy; became aware of the crowd admiring its
splendor, the plumed phœnix on the crest, the painted
images of children, tasseled flowers; she saw Edward's
woebegone face, the bright skirts of the women, all mixed
together by the trembling confusion of her eyes.  Then the
t'ai-t'ai advanced, holding out the long robe writhing with
golden dragons.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't my father coming?" the girl suddenly asked.
</p>

<p>
She was anxious that his hands at least should put the
veil over her face.
</p>

<p>
"He is not well enough to come," answered the t'ai-t'ai.
</p>

<p>
There was a guilty hesitation in the reply which caused
Nancy to look long and carefully at her stepmother.  For
a moment she delayed, for a moment even pondered brushing
aside all the futile ceremony in her mad wish to know
what was wrong with her father.  Then, as quickly, she
silenced the words on her lips and held out her arms to let
her body be vested with the heavy robe.  There was an
instant in which every heart seemed to stand still.  Acting
for Nancy's absent parents, the t'ai-t'ai fastened the long
veil of red silk across the face of the bride.  It was so thick
that the girl could see nothing.  Everyone stared in great
quietness at the muffled figure, which swayed a little when
the attendant women helped the bride step by step into her
chair.  She sat down, hidden away in darkness by the
curtained windows.  The doors were closed in front of her;
their two sides joined together the severed character for
happiness.  There was a perceptible click as the lock was
slipped into place, a bare instant before the fresh outburst
of crackers, the tumult of horns and flutes, the loud
weeping of the amah, the sound of Edward's crying, the
ear-shattering din as the musicians and lantern-bearers formed
their hectic procession, and the scarlet-girdled coolies
struggled with their huge chair.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had come close to her threat to stop thinking,
but she could not stop feeling, just as Ronald had predicted.
She sat, stiff and listless, making no effort to lift
the veil that cloaked her face.  There would be nothing to
see if she did.  The windows were too securely shrouded,
the doors too safely fastened.  She kept no count of time,
knowing the procession would thread many streets on the
way to her new home, making the bravest show money
would allow.  Far ahead came the repeated explosion of
crackers, almost incessantly the trumpets brayed, and the
flutes kept up their monotonous lilting music.  The girl
could feel the hum of people round her and hear the noise
of traffic in the streets brought to a momentary standstill
by her passing.  But she felt no glory, no exultation in this
high moment of her life.  Her body was cold with fear and
her heart already sick from loneliness, weary of the ride
yet dreading its finish, dreading her delivery like a
well-selected piece of merchandise into the hands of strangers.
</p>

<p>
Just when her mind had been lulled into a state of throbbing
blankness she realized that the roar of firecrackers
had redoubled, the musicians were blowing themselves
into an accelerated frenzy of noise; the pace of the coolies
slackened.  The chair was set down; the long poles were
withdrawn.  She felt men pick it up at the four corners, and
she clung to the sides as they toiled with their load, jerking
and pitching the unhappy bride across the threshold of
her new home.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult for Nancy to collect her spirits in the
great uproar of her arrival, but the heavy veil, hiding her
face from all observers, helped the girl at least to look
calm when the doors of the chair were unlocked and she
was led stiffly across the room and seated on the bridal bed
beside her husband.  She gave herself entirely into the
hands of her attendants.  At their direction she knelt and
bowed four times to the tablets of heaven and earth and
then to her still invisible husband.
</p>

<p>
Now came the great moment, when, having been seated
a second time beside Ming-te, she suffered him to lift the
veil from her face.  She felt rather than saw his anxiety,
felt rather than saw the curiosity of the crowd gathered in
the door, all breathless to see what the face of this foreign
bride should be.  There were reassuring exclamations of
approval, loud whispers of admiration at her beauty, all
bitter praise to the girl whose cheeks needed no paint to
heighten their flushed color.  In her bewildered trance
Nancy hardly knew what was done next.  She was too
shamefaced to steal even a glance at her youthful husband,
but received silently the gilded cups of wine with which
she and Ming-te plighted their troth.  She did not think
of touching the food which was set before them or to
make even the pretense of eating, but sat in mute
embarrassment, catching just a glimpse of Ming-te's trembling
hands as he helped himself to the nuptial cakes.  The
wedding was completed.  She knew that she was irrevocably
the wife of this unknown, still unseen stranger.  She had
no courage to lift her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
Through a long day's ceremonies she bore her part with
the same unbending dignity.  But all the time, when she
managed to be outwardly calm enough to worship alien
ancestors; to bow down before the parents of the bridegroom;
to stand beside her husband and, at the command
of the master of ceremonies, to do an endless series of
salutations to the many guests who had come; even in the
moments when she was allowed to withdraw with attendants
to her room, her real life went round and round in a
whirl of tempestuous thoughts.  The merrymaking, the
feasting, the noise and excitement of savory dishes being
served, of wine being drunk, wine being spilt, the loud
shouts of men at their games, touched her so lightly that
she did not observe a sudden change in the festivities, a
momentary pause as though of hearts stricken with fear,
words of whispered debate, before the renewal of the
merriment in a defiant spirit which was not loud enough to
drown the buzzing undertone of conversation in which the
word "unlucky," "unlucky," was bandied to and fro.  She
missed the first news that her father was dead, and went
tranquilly through the rites assigned to her without
knowing her new loneliness.
</p>

<p>
The news had thrown the feasters into consternation,
not because they had ever met or regretted Herrick, but
because his untimely death was so bad an augury for this
marriage.  To die in the height of the merrymaking&mdash;they
could not forgive him for that.  There were those who
deplored the strange match and thought he might have
died early enough to postpone, even to prevent it; others
thought he might have died later.  But to die when his
death could be neither hindrance nor help and with no
result except to throw gloom upon the feast, that was
unspeakably bad taste.  To the dismayed family of the
bridegroom the shock was still harder.  They were angry at
being balked even for a few days of the dowry which
should by now have been paid, and were not nearly so sure
as their kinswoman, the t'ai-t'ai, that Herrick had not
cheated them by his death.
</p>

<p>
For the moment, however, they tried to put the best face
on things and when the question arose as to whether the
girl should be told, they decided to leave her ignorant till
the morrow.  Fate had been spiteful enough.  It would
never do to mar the auspices of the bridal bed by mentioning
so unpropitious a word as death.  The first hush of
panic gave way to a delirium of mirth.  Hosts and guests
alike were determined to forget the grim shadow which had
disturbed them, to put outside the gates of their memory
the hideous demon who snatches souls from the living.
More and more hot wine they poured into the cups.  Voices
yelled; hands were flung helter-skelter in the fury of
"slippery fist," the wild game of guessing fingers and
urging one another into a state of drunken hilarity.  Everyone
sought to pledge the bridegroom till the unfortunate youth
scarcely could totter on his feet and saw lights and faces
going round in giddy spirals.  The young men who supported
him did stout duty in his defense, discarding the
wine cups little bigger than thimbles and calling for the
more capacious teacups in which to measure staggering
potations.
</p>

<p>
By evening time no one cared whether Herrick had died
yesterday or to-day or a thousand years ago.
</p>

<p>
People from the streets had joined the guests in a
clamorous entry into the bridal chamber, long before which
time Nancy had been taken from the quieter feast of the
women and prepared for the ordeal to which every Chinese
bride must submit, when she stands the rude inspection of
the crowd.  This is always an occasion of ribald
wit,&mdash;curiously allowed by the custom of years,&mdash;in which
strangers do their best by the indelicacy of their remarks
to disconcert and embarrass the "new woman."  But the
fact of Nancy's being a foreigner added spice to the event;
it made the girl a natural victim of the worst pranks the
crowd could concoct.  And the freedom with which wine
had flowed stirred men to pitiless depths of cruelty in
torturing their prey.  They teased the girl with unbridled lust
of word and gesture such as would have revolted any of
them in his right senses.  During the three long hours of
this orgy the husband of course remained discreetly
absent,&mdash;he was in fact too sick to come,&mdash;while Nancy was
compelled to stand beside the gaudy bed, submitting to
every whim of her tormentors without a word of defense
or even a sign that she was noticing their obscene spite,
and with no attendant except an amah almost as much a
stranger as the rest.
</p>

<p>
The men crowded round her in a mocking circle.  They
discussed every feature of her body with abominable
frankness, pulled up her skirts, pinched her legs, examined
the bangles on her arms, chucked her freely under the chin,
tried to force wine between her teeth.  The amah, whose
business it was to play the buffoon and draw these attacks
from her mistress by rollicking diversions, was too
mean-spirited a creature to perform her part, and let Nancy
suffer the full force of their lewdness unhindered.  There was
much laughter over the drunkenness of the bridegroom; he
would be quite unable to share the bridal bed, the crowd
boasted, and the most boisterous of them played fingers to
see who should sleep with this handsome foreign devil in
his place.  The thought tickled their wits; they pulled
out clothes from Nancy's boxes, dressed themselves in a
mocking masquerade, threw themselves on the bed, amid
howling applause, to portray an indecent drama of Nancy's
modesty and Nancy's shame.  Through it all she stood with
half-averted face, eyes and cheeks ablaze, pretending
neither to hear nor to see, knowing too well that the least
sign of anger would draw down the redoubled hostility of
her persecutors.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite her outward passivity, the experience was
burning deep marks upon her heart.  She began to realize
what she had protested against all her life, that she was in
truth a foreigner.  The pleasant manners of her father's
household had deceived her too long.  The little differences
between herself and her father's wives had been too slight,
too amiably adjusted, to make her know the cleavage of
race that divided her own instincts from the instincts of
the Chinese among whom she had been trained.  She had
beguiled herself with books, with romance and poetry,
with the language which came by first impulse to her lips,
but now she understood what a lie she had been living all
these wasted years.
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening, long after Nancy's feelings had been
outraged into a state of numbness, the coarse abuse of the
bride brought signs of reaction.  The befuddling effects of
the wine were wearing off and some began to feel compassion
for the girl who had borne so unflinchingly a measure
of evil treatment which even they, with many memories of
such bride-baiting, had never seen matched.  Sympathies
veered.  Those who had held their tongues through the
worst indignities now commenced to find them; their
appetite for cruelty was sated.  Yet the irony of the event
was that these impulses of pity should deal the girl her
sorest wound.
</p>

<p>
"Shame!" cried one man, hardier than the rest.  "You
are a coward to treat a girl so when her heart must be
sorrowing for the death of her father."
</p>

<p>
The remark, uttered with such loud scorn, hushed the
mob for a moment.  In their sport many had forgotten
Nancy's bereavement; some had never known of it.  The
fickle crowd responded to an instant's compunction.  There
ensued a brief but appalling silence, and when the sport
was resumed it was never with the former heartiness.
Little by little the throng began to dwindle.  Guests and
onlookers slipped away till only the more obstinate braves,
hilarious intimates of the family, stayed to stipulate with
the groomsmen a feast for the morrow as the price of their
leaving husband and wife to a first night's undisturbed
felicity.
</p>

<p>
But the outcry of Nancy's one defender, which was a
quickly forgotten incident to the others, made the torture
and coarseness of the evening trivial to the wretched girl
learning for the first time that her father was dead.  She
turned strangely calm, strangely rational, as though she
never had been so gravely alive, but her one mastering
desire was to talk to someone about her father, to pour
out her words, to make him live on the frantic accents of
her tongue.
</p>

<p>
At last the room was quiet.  The candles had been
changed for those which should burn through the night.
Nancy's mother-in-law appeared to speak a few formal
phrases to the bride and to see that the attending women
were doing their part properly in making her ready for
bed.  Then the bridegroom, amid fresh jesting on the part
of his family, was led to the chamber.  Nancy did not sit
up to look at him, but waited till the others had
withdrawn.  She heard them tittering outside, but she paid no
heed to other people, once the heavy doors had been shut.
With slow scrutinizing gaze she stared at the youth who
stood timidly beside the bed.  It was the first time she had
seen him.
</p>

<p>
Ming-te had a face marked both by intelligence and by
weakness.  He was handsome, with quick bright eyes, a skin
of singular clarity, a slightness of figure which made him
seem younger than the girl he had married.  His distaste for
being confined in this embarrassing loneliness with his
bride made him seem the weaker of the two, and Nancy
knew by instinct that he was no match for her strong will.
His family had overplayed their part in rousing his courage
with wine; he was trembling from the effects of sickness,
the nausea of unfamiliar drunkenness, and failed of
confidence to meet Nancy's look.
</p>

<p>
"Is my father dead?" the girl suddenly asked him.
</p>

<p>
He stammered with surprise at the directness of this
question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," at last he nerved himself to admit.
</p>

<p>
"How long have you known it?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I have known it&mdash;I don't know when I knew it."
</p>

<p>
"And you let them do all these things when you knew
my father was dead?"
</p>

<p>
The boy opposed a sullen reserve.  He felt it was wrong
that he should submit to scolding on the first night of his
wedding, but he was glad for any excuse to talk.  He was
afraid of this outspoken foreigner.  Nancy divined his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Did you wish to be married?" she asked.  "Your parents
made you, I suppose.  You had to be here, didn't
you?  I didn't.  I married to please my father."
</p>

<p>
There was pride in her voice, pride ill assorted with the
humiliation she had suffered, with the sorrow her heart
seemed not large enough to contain.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't please him.  I killed him.  I don't belong to
you," she cried, with a sudden gust of bitterness that
showed her shame had not been forgotten.  "I don't belong
to you.  I married to make my father happy, and he isn't
happy.  You are only a schoolboy; you don't understand
these things.  I don't see you; I see my father.  I don't even
think of you; I think of him.  They knew he was dead
and yet they went on with this marriage.  They deceived
me and tricked me into coming here when I ought to be at
home and weeping.  They put up red candles and sent the
red chair for me when they knew he was dead.  They
pulled you away from your books, did they, all because
they were afraid they would lose the money my father
promised?  And so they forced you to marry a
foreigner&mdash;how many taels was it?"
</p>

<p>
Ming-te stood like the schoolboy Nancy declared him to
be.  His attitude suggested dread of the ferule poised above
his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for you," Nancy went on.  "No luck will
come out of this marriage."  She looked at the huge gilt
characters on the scarlet banners which lined the wall.
"Hsi!  Hsi!  Hsi!  Hsi!" she exclaimed, mocking their
message of happiness.  "Happiness everywhere, paper
happiness.  There is no happiness in your heart or mine, and
you know it.  Your own ancestors would cry out against
the blasphemy.  I would never have worshiped them to-day
if I had known my father was dead.  We have disgraced
them.  I thought your family were an honorable family,
that they used to be officials, that they served the
Emperor, yet they have shown themselves no better than
small-livered coolies.  Happiness!" she muttered again with
intense passion.  "What happiness can result from
dishonoring the dead?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she forgot the awkward boy at her side.  The
aching freshness of her loss made her too miserable to defy
him.  She choked down a sob of despair, hiding her face
in the gayly embroidered pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my father, my father, my father," she wailed,
"why did you leave me, why did you leave me alone, why
couldn't you stay with me!  I want you!"
</p>

<p>
It was the first time her spirit had given way, the first
time she had broken down through all the prolonged travail
which had brought her so fearfully step by step to this
unendurable moment.  And as if to seize the advantage of
her defeat, the door opened; her new parents appeared.
They were white with anger at the tales of the eavesdroppers
who had been listening to the events of the bridal
chamber from outside and had heard Nancy upbraiding
her irresolute master.
</p>

<p>
"You call yourself a man," scoffed the mother, seizing
her son, "you a man, to be bullied by your wife on her
bridal night, to let her devil of a tongue steal your courage?
Small joy shall we have from such a yellow-mouthed
milksop as you!"
</p>

<p>
She bundled him like a disobedient truant into bed,
taunting him with her sarcasm, stinging him into hatred
for the girl who had made him ridiculous, till he did not
care whether he stifled her bruised body with his passion.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
</h3>

<p>
News of Herrick's death reached Ronald Nasmith almost
as quickly as it reached the family of the dead man.  The
t'ai-t'ai was anxious to settle the business of his estate
and lost no time in sending Edward, who could speak
English, as her ambassador.
</p>

<p>
Ronald was at home when the boy came.  He brought
him into his own study, for he knew, after one glance at
his face, the errand upon which he had come.
</p>

<p>
"My father is dead," said Edward, sitting stiffly on the
edge of his chair.  He could make no more than this simple
statement.
</p>

<p>
"I thought he must be," Ronald answered, "but where
is Nancy?  Why didn't she come with you?"
</p>

<p>
He was afraid to hear the answer, but hear it he must.
</p>

<p>
"She is married.  She was married yesterday."
</p>

<p>
Ronald toyed nervously with an ivory paper-cutter on
his desk.
</p>

<p>
"Only yesterday," he said at last; "and when did your
father die?"
</p>

<p>
"He died yesterday too."
</p>

<p>
"And who sent you to me?"
</p>

<p>
"The t'ai-t'ai."
</p>

<p>
"I understand."
</p>

<p>
He did understand much for which it was hopeless to
seek words.
</p>

<p>
"This will be your home now," he told Edward, "your
home till we can put you in a proper school.  I promised
your father that.  You don't wish to live there, do you,
now that your father has gone and Nancy has gone?"
</p>

<p>
"No," the boy answered bravely.
</p>

<p>
"Now I must see what I can do.  Your father left me a
lot of business to finish.  But you must come with me and
help me.  I might not make myself clear and there will be a
lot I shall need you to explain."
</p>

<p>
The boy accepted all that he said without question.
Together they returned to the mourning household, which
mocked the clear sunshine of the streets with its gloom.
Ronald had unutterable thoughts as he entered the gate
from which Nancy had gone out one day too soon in the
loneliness of her scarlet chair.  He could not bear to dwell
upon this picture, but asked to see the body of her father
and went with a sigh of weariness upon his lips into the
room where with difficulty, with much labored unbending
of stiff limbs, they had laid out the corpse.  The boy was
afraid to come in.  Ronald stood by himself and looked at
a face which made death terrible.
</p>

<p>
The women had taken up their burden of wailing when
he entered the house; harshly the noise struck his ears, for
in Herrick's quiet features he could find no answer to the
riddle of why the dead man had lived only to come to this
pitiless ending.  His only satisfaction was to see that
Herrick did not sleep peacefully, that he had not died content;
the restless lines in Herrick's face told their own story.
</p>

<p>
The ill-fated time of his death had upset his unstable
family.  The women could not face this blow right on
the heels of their excitement at Nancy's wedding.  In their
panic over what their future might be, they had neglected
the first rites of the dead and were weeping uselessly,
undecided what respect they should pay to the dead man
whom, despite his years of pretension, they remembered
only as a foreigner.
</p>

<p>
But the t'ai-t'ai was recovering her wits when Ronald
asked for her.
</p>

<p>
"She wants," Edward explained, after the formalities
of the meeting had been dealt with, "first of all to settle
the business of Nancy's marriage.  My father promised to
give ten thousand taels when she went to her new family,
but he died so quickly that he had no time to do this."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," said Ronald, "he told me about it and
that he expected to pay this himself.  But I can't do
anything yet."
</p>

<p>
The woman interrupted with a demand from Edward as
to what he was saying.  She seemed suspicious and unwilling
to let him proceed more than two or three sentences
without having his words explained.  Edward was visibly
embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"She wants that money now because that was promised
and Nancy's new parents will be angry if they don't get it.
It is more important than anything else."
</p>

<p>
"They will get it," said Ronald, "but I can't do anything
just now.  I can't touch a cent till your father's will
is proved."
</p>

<p>
Edward did not understand this last sentence, so Ronald
expressed his meaning at greater length.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he said, "your father was an Englishman,
not a Chinese, and subject to English law.  Even though
he lived in Chinese style and kept Chinese customs, that
makes no difference.  His death must be reported to the
British minister and all his papers have to be inspected, and
his will, which tells how he wishes his money divided, this
must be read and allowed.  Before this is done the bank
will not recognize me as his trustee and will refuse to pay
me any money, no matter how many checks I choose to
write."
</p>

<p>
The boy, still puzzled, did his best to explain these
details to the t'ai-t'ai, but it was clear that she was not
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"She wants you to pay the ten thousand taels," Edward
said, "then you can take it later from my father's money.
She wants you please to do this&mdash;never mind about the
other money; she can wait for that, but this money she
must have, because Nancy's family will be very angry."
</p>

<p>
Ronald laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't ten thousand taels," he declared, "or even
half the sum&mdash;and am never likely to have.  There is
nothing else to be done.  She will have to wait."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai did not believe these statements.  He was
being polite.  Of course he had ten thousand taels.  What
foreigner didn't have ten thousand taels?  She returned
again and again, in most tiresome pertinacity, to her
request that Ronald pay this money at once, waving aside his
most patient explanations as though she had never heard
them.  It was a strange thing, she remarked at last, that
the wife of the dead man could not be trusted to dispose of
his money: that a stranger had to be called in.
</p>

<p>
"But that's just the point," Ronald replied with much
exasperation; "the t'ai-t'ai, whatever she may be in Chinese
law, is no wife at all by English law.  Mr. Herrick
remained a British subject; he could not become Chinese
legally, despite his wish to do so, and therefore, unless he
married the t'ai-t'ai at the legation, which I very much
doubt, she is no wife in English eyes.  Just for that very
reason he called me in to help, so that I could safeguard
the interests of his family and see that they did not suffer
through his death."
</p>

<p>
He succeeded at last, by Edward's faltering assistance,
in driving these facts home.  The t'ai-t'ai resigned herself
to the existence of troublesome laws and to the more
immediate point that her hopes of securing her money hung
entirely on Mr. Nasmith's good offices.  There would be no
profit in making him angry.
</p>

<p>
"There is another thing," Ronald continued, when he
saw that she was in a more amenable mood; "as a trustee,
I feel especially responsible for Mr. Herrick's two English-born
children.  Of course I recognize that one of them, by
her marriage, is now outside my control.  But over Edward
here I have been placed as guardian by the authority of his
father.  Naturally I expect him to come to my home, and I
think when he does that you will understand that your
responsibility for his future ceases."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai had no objection to offer to this arrangement,
which her husband some months before his death
had explained to her.  She certainly did not wish to be
burdened with the problem of Edward.
</p>

<p>
"But to Nancy too," said Ronald, "I feel a sense of
duty.  I did not approve of her marriage and did my best
to persuade her father against it.  Personally I would
have been willing, if he had died earlier, to offer the ten
thousand taels just to set her free from what has always
seemed to me an unjust engagement for a girl of her
age.  If my powers as trustee allowed of this,&mdash;I can't be
certain, of course, that they did,&mdash;I would have taken this
risk of disobeying her father's wishes.  Well, it's too late
to discuss that.  Our ways, you see, and yours are different.
A few years of Chinese education couldn't make Nancy a
Chinese; I am sure of it.  But she is married; that can't
be mended; we have to make the best of it and I want to
see that the best is made of it."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai pricked up her ears at Edward's tactful
translation of this speech.  She wondered just what Ronald
had in mind when he wished to see that the best was being
made of Nancy's wedding.  Ronald, however, explained
himself further.
</p>

<p>
"I want to speak to Nancy herself," he said, "and have
her own assurance that she is being well treated.  I
presume that she will be coming back to her father's house
soon, won't she?"
</p>

<p>
"She has to stay three days with her husband," Edward
took it upon himself to answer; "then the wedding will be
finished and she can come here for a day.  That is our
custom.  Even though our father is dead, they will not
permit her to come before three days."
</p>

<p>
"And a nice home-coming it will be!" Ronald groaned.
"A cheerful place to return to.  Please tell the t'ai-t'ai
that when Nancy returns I must be here to see her and
speak to her.  I don't know what the Chinese custom is in
such a case, but this is absolutely necessary if I am to
perform my duties as a trustee in a satisfactory manner."
</p>

<p>
Edward communicated this demand, to which the t'ai-t'ai
gave a shrug of consent.  There was nothing these
foreigners appeared incapable of asking, but she was too
wholly in the man's power.  It was no time to quibble.
</p>

<p>
With this promise safely gained, Ronald told Edward to
gather up his things.  It was not healthy for the boy to stay
a minute longer than necessary in a household where
everyone's thoughts dwelt round the corpse of the dead master.
Edward went to his work listlessly and came back sniffing
and weeping after the woebegone task of dismantling the
room he had occupied so long.  Neither the sympathetic
help of his amah cheered him nor the welcome of his new
home, where David, awed by the distinction of one who
had lost his father, tried cautiously to say the appropriate
word.  Edward wanted Nancy; his heart was hungering
for her even when he thought he mourned for his father.
</p>

<p>
On the third day he went with his Uncle Ronald, as
already he had been taught to call his guardian, to see the
sister who had become a bride.
</p>

<p>
His own eagerness, if he had known it, did not exceed
Ronald's.  The intervening day had been a busy one.  Ronald
had been to the legation to have Herrick's will admitted
to probate.  He found friends who had known Herrick
long ago and who were avid for every last detail of
Herrick's story, but they could suggest no scheme for
saving Nancy.  It was a rotten business, they agreed with
some emphasis, but a matter which could not be helped, for
Nancy, by wedding a Chinese husband, had forfeited British
protection.  Ronald might use pressure, and they hoped
he would, to get the girl away from her husband,&mdash;there
was not one of them who expected the marriage to end in
any way except drastic misery,&mdash;but he had no lawful
right to divert any of Herrick's estate for the purpose.  The
estate, through remarkably clever investments, had once
been close to a fortune, but recently Herrick's intemperate
withdrawals had reduced it till it was barely enough to
cover the terms of his will.
</p>

<p>
So Ronald went impatiently to meet Nancy, determined
that if she gave him the slightest encouragement he would
break all the laws of the land to rescue her.  Early though
he went, the bride had arrived before him and had given
way to a frenzy of sorrow beside her father's coffin.  She
had not yet put on mourning, for the mother-in-law had
deemed it an unlucky thing to interrupt the first festal days
with any mark of sadness.  So she had come, oddly enough,
wearing a red skirt; but any suggestion of happiness had
been erased by the stains of grief which made her eyes
dull in their sunken pits and her skin a bloodless white.
</p>

<p>
It was the first chance Nancy had had to yield to her
passionate misery: for three days she had struggled against
tears, trying to preserve some semblance of joy in a family
which paid no heed to the death of her father.  The rites
of the wedding were dragged out till she was on the point
of fainting under the cruel burden.  She felt no love for the
husband who had been goaded into claiming her, and
suffered bridal intimacies from one who became worse than
a stranger in her eyes.  Beneath his treatment she felt the
hostility of a youth who had not desired this foreigner for
his wife, and beneath the treatment she met from her new
mother she felt the exasperation over delay in the payment
of her dowry, disappointment taking unkind shapes because
the woman had never forgiven herself for selling her son
into what was likely to prove a bad bargain.  For three
days the family had been most deliberately merry, trying
to face out their regrets in the sight of the world; they had
been reckless of how they spent money, but thrifty of a
single friendly word to the girl whose heart was breaking
while she pretended to smile.  At last they had let her go
home to weep.
</p>

<p>
When Nancy, who had comforted herself before marriage
with the hope of coming back to see her father,
realized that he too had deserted her and that she had not
won him a single day's peace by her sacrifice, she threw
herself down beside his coffin and wept till her body seemed
torn apart by her grief.  Edward, who in his turn was ready
to break down, understood the sudden need to control
himself, so that when the time came he could comfort his
sister in his affectionate boyish manner and bring her away
to the room where Ronald was waiting.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was dazed at seeing Ronald.  She did not seem
to know why he was there.  Her mind still lingered with
her father.  She had only perfunctory words to spare for
the living, while Ronald could hardly check the temptation
to carry her away by force, to carry her out of sight and
sound of this baneful household.  Everything he wanted
to say froze on his lips.  He had no heart to reproach the
girl for persisting in the wedding she might have stopped.
With her face marred by grief, he could not ask her if she
were happy, if she were contented with her new home.
The words would have mocked their own meaning.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," he did at last summon courage to say, "it is
no use weeping over the dead any more.  It doesn't help
them at all.  If your father doesn't know, then your tears
are wasted; if he does know, then he will be the more
unhappy to see you so sad.  The living are what we have to
think of&mdash;you and Edward.  If you want your father to
have peace, wherever he has gone, you must help him not
to worry over you.  You must let him know that you have
peace yourself.  Edward he won't worry about because he
asked me to take charge of him and so Edward has come
to my sister's to live, but you every one of us will worry
about till we are sure that you are well and happy.  That's
what you must tell me: you can speak as frankly as you
choose; there is no one here who dares to interrupt, but
I must know how I can help you."
</p>

<p>
"You can't help me," answered Nancy.
</p>

<p>
She was quieter now, but the hysterical stillness of her
manner frightened Ronald.
</p>

<p>
"That is no answer," exclaimed Ronald.
</p>

<p>
He was annoyed by the girl's obstinacy, which she had
inherited in too full measure from her father.
</p>

<p>
"You surely can be frank with me," he added, "because
I may never again be in such a position to help you.  You
know that I have your father's estate to divide.  As long
as the money, which includes ten thousand taels which were
to be paid at your wedding, as long as this remains in my
hands I can make almost any terms you may wish with the
t'ai-t'ai.  But when it has been divided, then my power will
be gone.  Now do you regret your bargain?  Are you sorry
you kept to this marriage?  Do tell me now, when I can
help you."
</p>

<p>
He had realized Nancy's stubbornness; he had not
measured her pride.
</p>

<p>
"My marriage is what I expected," she answered.
</p>

<p>
How could she tell him the shame of the last three days?
How could she relate the scornful treatment of her new
family?  She might have told Kuei-lien; she had no words
to speak of it to Ronald.  She could not run to him like a
weakling tired of her promise.  To endure the mischances
of her marriage was no more than keeping faith with her
father's good name.  She was a wife; that was the end of
it.  But Ronald seemed to read her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what your new home is like," he argued,
"but I do know what you are like, and I can hardly imagine
you happy under the conditions you will find there.  Just
now your sorrow for your father makes everything else
seem of small account, but the time will come when the
sharpness will wear off and you will have to think of the
man you have married and the life you have adopted.  For
it is an adopted life; it is not natural to you.  Now your
father is dead, don't make a mistake of your loyalty to
him and think you have to embrace years of misery merely
to gratify his memory.  That's not good enough.  They
don't want you&mdash;I can see that; they only want the money
that was promised with you.  Nothing would please them
better than to get this money without the necessity of
taking you.  You are a foreigner and always will be a foreigner
to them.  Can't you come home with Edward and me, and I
will promise, if I have to move heaven and earth, to get
your marriage annulled."
</p>

<p>
"If they want my money, they have to take me," said
Nancy stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
She was not doing justice to Ronald's proposal, while the
man, in his turn, was far from seeing her marriage as she
saw it.  She could not appreciate how in his foreign eyes
her marriage was no marriage, nor could he see how to her
Chinese eyes it was a bond from which there was but one
honorable escape for the wife, the extreme measure of
suicide.  Ronald had been reading deeply in the customs of
the Chinese the better to understand Nancy's case, but he
missed the essential fact of her attitude, the value she set
by her good name.  To have run away because she was
displeased with her first three days of wedded life seemed
an act of intolerable cowardice.  Nancy's every thought
was Chinese, more Chinese than Kuei-lien's: she had an
inbred fear of disgrace, not only for her own sake but for
her father's whose reputation rested helplessly in her care.
So she met Ronald's most persuasive entreaties with the
same blank answer.  If she had grounds for quarreling
with her husband or with his parents it was no business of
an outsider to know of them.
</p>

<p>
At last Ronald despaired of moving her.  He gave up
the attempt.  He was as sure as he was sure of his own
love for the girl that she was unhappy in her new home and
would grow week by week unhappier, but she was less
responsive to his words now than before her marriage.  He
threw down his hands with a hopeless gesture, inwardly
cursing the folly of Timothy Herrick, which was able to
survive him in such fatuously obdurate wrong-headedness.
Nancy's white, troubled face reminded him of his first
glimpse of her in the temple.  How much greater was her
danger to-day than in that first perilous meeting.  How
much less he could help her.  Unable to leave the girl
without one sign of his deep overmastering passion, he
crossed the room and kissed her gently on the forehead.
</p>

<p>
"I shall always love you, Nancy," he said.
</p>

<p>
Nancy trembled a little beneath the touch of his lips, but
the kiss came so naturally that she had no time to be
surprised and could only wonder long afterward at the trance
which had held her silent under so strange a greeting, so
strange a token of farewell.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
</h3>

<p>
Ronald did not see Nancy again until the day of Timothy
Herrick's funeral.  On that dreary day she was more
remote than ever, wearing her headdress of white sackcloth
and weeping loudly.  Even Edward, who had thrown off
many vestiges of his Chinese upbringing in the short time
he had lived with the Ferrises, fell back disconcertingly
into old habits and was as Chinese as Herrick's half-caste
children when he had donned his coat of coarse bleached
calico.
</p>

<p>
Ronald rightly insisted that as Herrick had lived so
should he be buried, and he advised the t'ai-t'ai to spare
none of the rites suitable to a mandarin of her husband's
rank.  He brought Beresford with him to the funeral.
Beresford was intrigued by the many peculiar rites, but
Ronald listened to it all with insufferable weariness and
wondered if the priests were ever to be finished chanting
their guttural prayers.  Each stroke of bell and drum
seemed to remove Nancy farther than ever from his hopes,
tangling her spirit in an alien region from which she would
never come out again.  He saw nothing picturesque in the
great scarlet catafalque put over Herrick's coffin, the silk
umbrellas, the tables with their food for the dead, the
spirit chair intricately wrapped in white muslin, the horrid
crayon copy of Herrick's photograph, borne in a chair of
its own, the bright silken copes of the priests, their
contrast with the rags of the beggars, who carried white
banners certifying to the merits of the dead, the green-clad
coolies who labored with the weight of the coffin, the
pervading smell of incense and burning sandalwood&mdash;these
were all details which Ronald might have noted with an
interested eye if he had not been oppressed by their
meaning for Nancy.  It was her tragedy that when those who
loved her could bring the girl no comfort, she had to seek
relief in this pitiless barbarity which seemed to sing her
father's failure, his exile from his own people, his cheerless
sojourn in the cold places of the dead.
</p>

<p>
All this Ronald heard in the weird music of the procession,
as the coffin and its mourners moved slowly toward
the gates of the city; he felt that the road Timothy Herrick
was traveling, this same road there was no one to prevent
his daughter from taking, despite all her lovable instincts
for joy and for beauty&mdash;no one good enough to prevent
her from following in her own desolate hour.
</p>

<p>
Beresford, however, thought the whole funeral very
splendid.  So much better, he declared, than being
reminded of the skin-worms, and forced to linger in the
sickly smell of a church which had been banked like a
flower-seller's shop while bald-headed gentlemen trundled
the coffin with exaggerated slowness up the aisle.  He
envied Herrick's escape from those absurd rites and from
being consigned into eternity by the throaty reading of a
curate in a starched surplice.  This brilliant procession,
winding with such an unrehearsed mixture of carelessness
and dignity, did seem in his eyes to express more reasonably
the tragic naturalness of death.  Even Ronald, before
they had reached Herrick's burial-place, began to feel
himself haunted by the sobbing voice of the flutes and to
know that this garish splendor was the ancient and simple
way of keeping up man's courage before the mystery of
death.  It was a shock, on coming outside the city, to see
the coffin stripped of its pall, the umbrellas and chairs
sent back, as though the chief object of the parade had been
not to honor the unseeing dead but to win honor from
the populous streets of the city, yet the quiet which ensued
induced meditations that were not unpleasing though they
were sad.  Autumn lay with warm sunshine on the land;
sloping shafts of light made the dry grass glow; wide and
blue was the sky.  The only sound was the low-toned note
of a gong which a priest rang from time to time as he
walked in front of the coffin.
</p>

<p>
Ronald was moved by the loneliness of Herrick's burial-ground.
It was so tranquil that he, too, half envied the
dead man's privilege of sleeping quietly with all the scenes
he had loved, the serene clarity of the Western Hills, the
climbing palaces of Wan Shou Shan, the towers and golden
roofs of Peking, compassing from the far distance the
little circle of pine and cypress round the grave.  Ronald's
spirit was hushed by the stillness.  The man looked idly
at the four characters gilded on the end of Herrick's coffin:
"Hai returns to the halls of spring," they said, and for the
first time Ronald believed that there was immortality in
lying here beneath the open spaces of heaven.  A fresh
outburst of wailing, the burning of paper money, and
exploding of crackers could not touch the peace of a heart
fortified by the strangely comforting thought that life was
soon over.
</p>

<p>
The grave was ready at two, but the hour was
even-numbered, unlucky; mourners and priests and workmen
waited in little gossiping groups till the more fortunate
hour of three, when the coffin was lowered into the grave
with the lavish sunshine pouring down upon it as if to
make amends for Herrick's last sight of day.  Every clod
that had been dug was thrown scrupulously upon the round
mound of the grave.  Edward knelt down and wept; Nancy
wept and bowed her forehead to the ground; the women
prostrated themselves, tearing their hair and their clothes.
Ronald stood watching dumbly, but he got his moment of
reward when Nancy rose, for she gave him one searching
look, one glance of understanding and love, over which
hovered the trembling flicker of a smile.  She showed she
had not forgotten his kiss; this was her answer.  So
completely, indeed, had Nancy seemed to belong to him
throughout all the tedious hours of the funeral that Ronald
remembered afterward, with some amazement, that among
the gathering of the t'ai-t'ai's family, which followed the
coffin, he had not knowingly set eyes upon or even thought
of singling out Nancy's husband.
</p>

<p>
After Herrick had been buried, there was nothing to
keep him from dividing what remained of his money.
Ronald was anxious to be done with the task.  He exacted
but one promise, a promise from the t'ai-t'ai that when
Nancy's first month of married life was complete and the
girl, as custom allowed, was able to sleep a few nights
under another roof than her husband's, she should come
to his sister's home instead of the father's house she ought
to have visited.  This was reasonable, for Edward was the
only kinsman left to her.
</p>

<p>
Herrick's pretentious household melted away.  Each wife,
when she received her money, took pains to put herself
out of the t'ai-t'ai's reach.  There was none of them that
wished to be slave to that arrogant lady.  With a
contemptuous smile she watched them scatter.  After they and
their children and their bundles and bedding and their
wrangling servants had gone, she gave up the lease of the
house Herrick had occupied so long, sold what she could
of his furniture, and betook herself to her brother's.  Of
the line her husband had been so ambitious to found,
literally not even the name remained.
</p>

<p>
Ronald took care to obtain and note the t'ai-t'ai's
address; Nancy's bridal month was so nearly finished that
he could not govern his eagerness to have her come.  The
rest of Herrick's family he made no effort to trace.  Except
the amah, who of course remained with Edward, they
might scatter to the winds for all he cared.  But suddenly
one evening when the Ferrises had finished dinner a
hubbub in the kitchen woke them from the lethargy of
worrying about Nancy, for Edward's presence among them had
been a continual reminder of his sister's absence; they
jumped up in alarm when the old nurse rushed gasping into
the room, crying out, "They've gone, they've gone!"  It
took them some minutes to understand what she meant.
Not till Kuei-lien appeared and rapidly poured out her
story to Edward was the cause of the amah's excitement
understood.
</p>

<p>
To their consternation they learned that the t'ai-t'ai
had broken her promise.  She had gone with her brother
and his whole family back to their native town of Paoling.
And Nancy, as naturally she must do, had gone with them.
It was the last blow.
</p>

<p>
The other details of Kuei-lien's story were more
interesting to Edward than to his discouraged guardian.
The one fact which might have been of use, her coming
from the same town as the t'ai-t'ai, was robbed of
advantage because the girl did not dare nor intend to go
home.  If she had done so she would have been handed over
to the t'ai-t'ai by her stupid and covetous family.  She was
the single one of Herrick's concubines whom his wife had
tried to retain.  Her parents were dependents of the Chou
family, absolutely under their orders, while the t'ai-t'ai not
only did not like losing a slave of Kuei-lien's beauty and
cleverness but still more regretted letting her escape with
the money she had gathered.  Their separation had cost
them a quarrel.  The t'ai-t'ai had commanded the concubine
to remain, had threatened to hold her boxes and to have
the girl beaten.  If Kuei-lien had been less bountiful in
bribing the servants, she could not have got away.  The
t'ai-t'ai's stinginess had proved her safety.
</p>

<p>
So Kuei-lien, meditating new plans, lay low.  She
cultivated the friendship of the amah, husbanded the money
she owned, while she looked for chances to get more.  And
because she maintained some slight connection with
Pao-ling and might get them news of Nancy, the Ferrises
were pleased to let her stay.  They did not guess a tenth of
her plans nor realize that she was using the shelter of their
servant quarters to let it be known she was under foreign
protection, that any offense offered to her would be visited
upon the offender by the King and Parliament of Great
Britain.
</p>

<p>
As for poor Nancy, the King and Parliament of Great
Britain had lost interest in her.  The secluded Chihli
village of Paoling kept her as hidden from prying strangers
as the fastnesses of Turkestan.  Nancy had never been told
of the promise that she should visit Edward in his new
home.  She was saved this disappointment.  But she knew it
was the last step away from her friends when her
mother-in-law summoned her to pack and to get up long before
dawn for the cold dark ride to the station.  Long as she had
lived in Peking, the city was a place strange and unfamiliar
to the girl, yet she conceived a fondness even for the
arches and walls she barely could descry in the darkness,
for she felt she should never set eyes upon them again.
</p>

<p>
With the rest of her husband's family she bundled
uncomfortably into a third-class carriage, squeezing herself
so tightly between baskets and bedding that she sat as
though cramped stiffly in a vise.  Everyone spoke shrilly;
the early hour, the bitterly frosty morning, had set their
tempers on edge.  No one was in a mood to enjoy the
novelty of a railway ride.  Nancy looked wearily at the
dingy houses they passed, wondered if their occupants
could be unhappier than she was; she saw in the distance
the blue roofs of the Temple of Heaven, but paid no heed;
if her legs had not been so stiff, her whole body aching
from the need of movement, she might have gone to sleep
counting the numbers of the telegraph poles.  Her mind
did go to sleep; her body persisted in staying painfully
awake.
</p>

<p>
She was grateful to get off the train, grateful to shake
her numb legs into life, pulling boxes and bales quickly out
of the car.  The t'ai-t'ai and her mother-in-law gave
contradictory orders, they wrangled and shouted, pulling
servants helter-skelter, scolding Nancy, scolding her husband;
they were only one of many groups invoking heaven and
hell in their panic lest the train should start before the last
bundle had been rolled out of the window.
</p>

<p>
By a miracle they got themselves untangled and down
to the platform, where the women sank breathless on rolls
of bedding, waiting for a bargain to be struck with the
mule-drivers.  This was not quickly nor quietly done and
Nancy, used to having these small matters arranged without
her presence, despaired of its ever being done at all.  To
the mule-drivers and their opponents, however, the hiring
of a cart was more heady business than speech in a public
forum.  Not till vulgar interest was diverted to Nancy,
whose presence in this company became an eighth day's
wonder, did the arguing parties see that their prominence
of the moment had passed; they made the same bargain
they could have made half an hour back.  Chou hsien-sheng
swore he was cheated, the drivers swore they were robbed,
but the price they fixed had been the unchanging rate for
a decade.
</p>

<p>
Nancy was glad to get into her cart, even to be thriftily
crowded among three women servants and a suffocating
mass of baggage.  She had not enjoyed the ring of staring
eyes which had surveyed her nor the coarse guesses of the
people as to her history, guesses loudly and impudently
debated with many rustic guffaws over the joke of a
foreigner reduced to Chinese clothes and the whims of a
Chinese master.
</p>

<p>
All day long the carts moved slowly forward, lumbering
in ruts, shaking the teeth of their passengers on miles of
chipped highway, ploughing deep through sand.  Nancy
was acutely mindful of other mule-cart journeys, the rides
to the Western Hills, when Edward and Kuei-lien had been
her comrades and each new turn of the road had tempted
their eyes to objects of joyful interest.  She was scornful
of the ignorant maids squashed into this unpleasant contact,
closed her eyes to avoid seeing their puffy faces; their
few monosyllables were like a parody of human speech.
They wheezed and grunted and reeked of garlic till Nancy
wondered why she could not withdraw all her senses, as
she had withdrawn her sense of sight, and shut herself
from these clownish wenches like a mussel in its shell.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before dark the carts lurched down the sunken
streets of Paoling.  It was like all the other villages they
had passed, dusty and poor.  Dikes of baked mud served
for walls.  Two policemen lounged at the gate as though
the place were not worth their vain offer of protection.
Mud and gray tile and leafless trees, streets without shops,
worn into deep trenches, people clothed in rags so dirty
that the very patches were blended to a greasy uniformity
of color&mdash;not an item relieved the drab scene.  And the
home of her husband, Nancy found, was a consistent part
of its surroundings.  It was filthy, musty, and cold, a huge
ramshackle place replete with tottering chairs and tables,
its stone floors overlaid with grime, its courtyards heaped
with dung.  Only rats and spiders seemed fit to inhabit such
a place and Nancy's heart became chill with dismay when
she thought of dragging out her life in this cheerless hole.
</p>

<p>
In a panic of sheer terror she was taken to greet Ming-te's
grandmother, the matriarch of the clan, the old lady
whose temper she had heard discussed with lively fear
during the month she had been married.  She shrank from
being led to something more terrible than any of the evil
things she had seen.  Her nerves were so unstrung by the
weariness and misery, the depressing finish of the day,
that she was ready to shriek.  She halted stock-still in a
room ill lit by native wicks.
</p>

<p>
"Kneel," chided the voice of her mother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
Nancy knelt and kowtowed three times before the
august personage to whose face she had not yet presumed
to raise her eyes.  She waited, prostrate on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Lift her, you fools," cried a voice that showed by its
testiness it was used to being obeyed.  "Can't you see
she is worn with weariness?"
</p>

<p>
The other women hastened to help Nancy to her feet.
The girl looked wonderingly at the little old woman who
sat muffled in quilted satin on the k'ang.  From a face
crossed and transcrossed with wrinkles burned eyes whose
haughtiness spoke an older and a finer generation than the
women to whom Nancy had been subjected.  Her mother-in-law's
were dog's eyes compared with them.  Nancy lost
her fear.  The eyes brought memories of her father.  They
seemed to pierce, with their sadness, their cynical
discontent, the very mysteries of life.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, my child," said the old woman gently.
"Come and sit with me and tell me how you are.  I have
waited a long, long time to welcome you."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
</h3>

<p>
In the first relief that followed this kindly greeting, Nancy
nearly broke down.  Tears welled to her eyes, do what she
would to hold them back.  She could not help sobbing,
but the old woman stroked her hands as though she knew
the misery pent up in the heart of this alien bride.
</p>

<p>
"My husband and your father were friends," she said,
"and I am glad that his daughter has become my
granddaughter.  But it's hard, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
She gave a little chuckle, seeming to appreciate her own
experiences as a bride in years which only a handful of
bent gray figures like herself still lived to remember.
Nancy could have lived as long without forgetting this
reception by the wise old woman whose harsh tongue she
had been taught to dread.  It came with such sudden,
blinding beauty at the end of a comfortless journey, at the
end of four suffering weeks in which her spirit had been
tortured nearly to the limits of its endurance!
</p>

<p>
Nancy would have suffered much from the women, from
her mother-in-law and from her stepmother&mdash;for the latter
visited on the daughter her anger over the justice of
Timothy Herrick's will&mdash;and even at the hands of lesser
people, who took their pattern from this spiteful pair, but
she had hoped for some measure of sympathy, some pity,
even if there could not be love, from the youthful stranger,
Ming-te, who had been given the rights of a husband over
her life.
</p>

<p>
In this she was disappointed.  Ming-te felt that there
was no one with a grievance comparable to his own.
His parents, however much they might dislike this
foreigner in the family, had invited her by their own choice.
But he had been given no choice.
</p>

<p>
Like most youths of his modern day, he detested being
bound by an early marriage even to a girl of his own race;
he detested being set to breed heirs for the pleasure of his
parents.  He envied the new laxities of Shanghai and
Peking, the parody of Western freedom carried on under the
guise of choosing one's wife for one's self.  He was eager to
push aside convention, to realize republican liberty by
bursting all restraint; he was a student, member of a class
bound by no laws of right or reason, to whom all things
ought to be allowed in the pursuit of knowledge; yet just
when his imagination had begun to run riot over the
thought of embracing slim girl students to the mutual
advancement of their studies, when he was becoming
conscious of his own sacred importance as the hope of China
and the flower of creation, he had been put under restraint
like his forefathers, suddenly, brutally married, his hopes
dashed.  And his sacrifice had been unmentionably worse
than theirs; he, the heir of the ages, had amounted to so
little in the eyes of his elders that they had flung him a
foreigner for a bride!
</p>

<p>
So Ming-te, the handsome, spoiled idol of his parents,
took his marriage in bad grace and vented his spleen on
Nancy.  He did not take the trouble to see whether here
might not be the ideal comrade of whom he had prated so
freely in the safe company of his friends; he had made up
his mind to dislike the girl long before he set eyes upon
her.  The disgrace of his bridal night, his sheepishness, the
mockery of his family, of which he still heard the echoes,
were an added score to be wiped out.  And because he
could not avenge himself on her mind he tried to avenge
himself on her body, for at heart he was afraid of Nancy;
at heart he realized her contempt for his shallowness and
conceit; he seemed to see her eyes despising him as a
weakling, a petulant small boy, till she challenged him to
ecstasies of cruelty to prove that he was indeed her master.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had learned many undreamed-of things during
this month, but nothing more dumbfounding than the fact
that real sorrow is an experience without appeal; it has no
glamour, no romance.  It is like a headache which goes on
forever.  She wondered at the vernal innocent person she
had been, blithely offering herself for a life of torture, as
though it were no more than one of those tempestuous
black tragedies of childhood which last for an hour, then
ripple peacefully away like bird notes after a storm.  It
seemed so splendid to sacrifice herself, against the protests
of Ronald and his nieces and Edward and Kuei-lien and
even her father himself; she had been thrilled by her own
daring even when her heart was cold with the prospect,
so that, while she entered the bridal chair sad and afraid,
longing to cling to everything she was forsaking, some
small part of her could not forbear standing aside to gloat
over the picturesque courage of her deed.
</p>

<p>
But she had been wakened too unmercifully from her
dream; her vanity, so excusable, so childishly serious,
broken by a punishment out of all justice to what it
deserved.  Her days of shyness were passing.  She was
putting off the bride to put on the shrew&mdash;in that
hard-mouthed family no other role was safe&mdash;when her regrets
for the folly of her sacrifice suddenly dissolved and her
heart swelled with pride, with thankfulness, because she
had kept faith with an old lady she had never met, who
greeted her in the twilight of a gray day, saying, "I have
waited a long, long time to welcome you."
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai and her sister-in-law were more surprised
than Nancy.  They were dismayed.  What the old t'ai-t'ai
said, she meant; she had come to an age when she
did not trouble to hide her thoughts of other people, but
ruled her clan, as the last of the oldest generation, with an
unsparing frankness such as made them quail.  Hers was a
witty, biting tongue which she found life too short to
think of bridling; she did not like her daughter, still less
her daughter-in-law, thought none too highly of her sons,
and, as for her grandchildren, she called them a litter of
gaping puppies.  Her mind was a catalogue of their faults;
she could make the best of them wince with a single
sharply prodding phrase, for there was nothing ridiculous
that any of them had done, and wished with all his heart
to forget, that she could not recall when the occasion suited
her.  Grown men writhed for a pretext to get beyond
earshot of her chuckle.
</p>

<p>
Yet she did not welcome Nancy kindly&mdash;as the t'ai-t'ai
and her sister-in-law concluded&mdash;merely to annoy them.
Her instinct, which always was extravagantly right, had
told her that Nancy would be a friend.  She did not care
whether Ming-te had a wife or not, but she longed for
someone young, someone talented and pretty, to whom she
could talk and be kind.  Her own family bored her.  She
yawned when she thought of them.  They were a small,
petty-minded generation, while her memory dwelt upon
the large days of the past.  Her loyalty was all to the past,
to her husband and his father, to the family in its time
of splendor, before its name had been dragged in the dust
by a progeny that forsook their books and squabbled over
cash like beggars fighting in the street.  So she had ruled
them with a testy loneliness, glad to be alive only because
she knew they would be glad if she were dead.
</p>

<p>
Her first glimpse of Nancy satisfied the keen-sighted old
tyrant.  She drew the pale girl to her side like a child.
</p>

<p>
"It's a long time since I've seen anyone really young,"
she said, "young and wise together as they used to be.
Now we have a republic; men don't trouble about wisdom
and they think they can rule the eighteen provinces before
they have left off their mother's milk.  You have read
books, I have heard, and can write poems.  Your father
would see to that.  He knew our customs.  He was one
of us."
</p>

<p>
She could be tactful when she chose; in her questions
about the death of Nancy's father she soothed rather than
irritated the quick feelings of the daughter.
</p>

<p>
"To die on the day of your wedding, ai, that was a
strange thing.  I have lived many years, but I have never
heard the like.  That was a proof that he loved you, my
child.  You must remember such a father.  And you have
a brother, too; where is he?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy told the story of Edward's friends.
</p>

<p>
"So you have Western friends.  How did you come to
make them?"
</p>

<p>
Paragraph by paragraph she drew from Nancy's lips the
tale of how they had met and visited the Ferrises.  The
old lady enjoyed the freshness of the girl's story.  She
wanted most exact details of how these foreigners lived.
</p>

<p>
"It must have surprised them to see one of their own
blood living in the fashion of a Chinese.  Did you like their
ways?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," Nancy admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Do you like our ways better?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was surprised at the question and reluctant to
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps&mdash;sometimes," suggested the old grandmother,
answering herself, and turned to laugh at the shadow of
the smile Nancy could not hide.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid of me," she said, patting the girl's
hand from pleasure at her own jest.  "I shall be your father
and your mother from this time forth&mdash;hm-m, just like
a magistrate, remember.  You can tell your troubles to me
as freely as you please and, even if the walls have ears,
they won't dare speak till I let them."
</p>

<p>
Her words lulled Nancy into a pleasing warmth of
security.  She forgot her weariness, the despair with which
she had risen this very morning to start on a hopeless
journey, for the old t'ai-t'ai's words were spoken with the
authority of one who could promise peace when she wished
and protection to those she liked.  And she really liked
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Your Western friends," she resumed, "they must have
been appalled by your marrying a Chinese.  Did they try
to dissuade you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they did try."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, of course, they wouldn't understand.  And perhaps
they were right.  You may go back to them some day;
who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, I shall never go back to them," Nancy protested,
dreading lest the woman should doubt her loyalty
to the promise she had made.
</p>

<p>
"Young people, my daughter, should never use the word
'never.'  When you are as old as I am and have to think
soberly of the spring winds as not just a chance to fly
kites, then 'never' means something; ah, it means too much.
There is so much happiness I shall never know again, so
many faces I shall never see.  But you, with your handful
of years, there is no 'never' for you.  You thought to-day
you would never smile again.  You had heard of me,
hadn't you, and trembled to meet a bad-tempered old
grandmother; don't deny it&mdash;I saw it in your face when
they made you kneel.  I shall not be bad-tempered to you,
child.  We old people like to have flowers about us.  I
shall be selfish of your company and most surely will
begrudge you to others.  And will you be sorry?  Aha,
I don't think you will.  Your father must have taught you
wisely for you remind me of children as they used to be
when I was young.  I am tired of being waited on by
servant maids or by people who wonder when I'm going
to die.  Why should I die just to make fools more
comfortable in their folly!  No, I shall not be bad-tempered to
you, because you are the first person I have had round me
for years who really wished me to live.  But I'm not going
to share you."
</p>

<p>
How firm were her intentions was soon shown, for
Nancy's mother-in-law came in to say, in a voice too
carefully matter-of-fact, that if the old t'ai-t'ai had been
gracious to say all she wished to the 'hsi-fu,' they hoped
she would give her permission to withdraw, for there was
much work to be done and her room to be set right.
</p>

<p>
"And whose work, indeed, is she to do, if not mine?"
asked the old t'ai-t'ai.  "Her room we can discuss later,
but to-night her room will be here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that would not be convenient," faintly
protested the younger woman; "we must not separate the
bride from her husband.  My mother speaks this out of her
kind heart, but surely it would make my mother
uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
"It will be entirely convenient," snapped the dowager.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, that is only what we wished to be sure of,"
said Ming-te's mother hastily, "we wanted to make sure of
your comfort."
</p>

<p>
Yet the next day she was still so far from being satisfied
of the old t'ai-t'ai's comfort that she asked her sister-in-law
to intercede and to get Nancy out of the old lady's
clutches before it was too late.  Hai t'ai-t'ai, Nancy's
step-mother, was more than ready to try, for she knew that
while the old lady lived, if they did not make a stand
quickly, Nancy would be lost to their control.  She had a
portion of her mother's independence and did not cringe in
the august presence as her sister-in-law was apt to do.
Waiting a chance when Nancy was absent, she went boldly
into the den.
</p>

<p>
"You have come to ask after my health, have you?"
inquired her mother brusquely.  "My health is excellent,
this morning.  It has done me great good to meet someone
new.
</p>

<p>
"We are so glad that the foreign hsi-fu meets with
your favor," lied the daughter cheerfully.  "I thought
of your comfort when I began to arrange the match."
</p>

<p>
"Did you?  Well, you thought most intelligently, so
intelligently that I have decided to keep her as my
companion, to give her the room next to mine."
</p>

<p>
"Your companion, by all means," agreed Hai t'ai-t'ai,
"but not too much your companion.  We can never permit
her to tire you with her prattle.  She might become spoiled
and think you were indulging her in liberties only fit for
yourself.  I have known her for many years and I speak
the truth when I say she is difficult to control.  She puts
forward a good face at first, but she is an obstinate,
self-willed child, not always obedient to her elders.  Her
training was sadly neglected because she was left to the charge
of an indulgent old amah&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you think her training will suffer at my hands, do
you?" interrupted the old t'ai-t'ai with a laugh, "you
fear that I will be another indulgent old amah to her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, not at all, but we trembled to put the burden of
her training in your hands."
</p>

<p>
"You are all very busy people.  What is there for an
old woman like myself to do?  I shall be happy to take the
burden of her training into my hands.  When I weary of it,
I have a tongue; I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
The daughter shrugged her shoulders.  Nancy always
had been a mischievous obstacle to her plans; and now,
with her new ally, was more dangerous than ever.  Her
hands itched to beat the wench.  But she went on in smooth
tones:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We must be just to Ming-te."
</p>

<p>
"I am just to Ming-te."
</p>

<p>
"But he has had his bride only for a month.  Is it right
to leave the boy lonely without a mate for his bed?  These
things mean so much to the young.  If he is lonely, he may
go out to drink and to gamble with evil companions.  He
did not want to marry, yet for our sake he did even more:
he married a foreigner to help his family.  And now, when
he is beginning to understand her excellent qualities&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Self-willed and obstinate," reminded the t'ai-t'ai.
</p>

<p>
"To understand her excellent qualities," continued the
daughter, as though she had not heard the interruption,
"and is beginning to appreciate her for his wife, you surely
would not reward his unselfishness by taking her away and
making her a stranger to him.  What of the future of the
family?  How will they learn to live together in peace and
harmony like&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Like a sparrow and a phœnix," suggested the mother
wickedly.  Hai t'ai-t'ai flushed in annoyance, but the
dowager stopped her from speaking.
</p>

<p>
"How will they learn to live together in peace and
harmony?" she echoed.  "Ah, my daughter, you are old
enough to answer that question, or must I answer it for
you and say they never will learn.  If you could have got
fifteen thousand taels without this girl, would you have
taken her?  No, indeed not.  But I would have taken her
without a cash.  So she belongs to me.  She will never be
of any use to this family because I am the only one who
knows how to use her.  And I am old&mdash;and I have no
husband to give her.  She will be safer with me.  If Ming-te
wants a bedfellow, get him one.  You can afford to spend
on him a little of the money he has earned.  Buy him a
nice, good-tempered, pretty wife; the country is full of
them.  He will be happy, you will be happy, and I shall
have peace."

CHAPTER XXXII
</h3>

<p>
Nancy returned to find the formidable old t'ai-t'ai
crowing over her triumph.  To outwit her daughter was always
tonic which put new life in her veins.
</p>

<p>
"Can you choose between your husband and me?" she
asked, with her usual terrifying directness.
</p>

<p>
Nancy knew the time for a straight answer.
</p>

<p>
"I can choose," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Bravely spoken," said the old lady in her glee, "you
are too clever to be a mere bedfellow."
</p>

<p>
Nancy saw what was coming next but waited carefully
so as not to miss her cue in this game of frank riddles.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen your husband's room?"
</p>

<p>
"I have seen it."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think of this room next to mine?"
</p>

<p>
The woman pointed to an open door.  Nancy followed
her indication and looked into a neat bare chamber, scoured
cleaner than most of the apartments in this dilapidated
house.
</p>

<p>
"The air is better here," she said smiling.
</p>

<p>
The lao t'ai-t'ai beamed with approval of her words.
</p>

<p>
"All said neatly in a phrase, as a scholar ought to say it,"
she thought to herself, "not a breath of complaint about
her husband, not an undutiful syllable, and yet the whole
story clear as the sun."
</p>

<p>
"Ai, my daughter," she said, "that is to be your room.
Your wit would be wasted anywhere but here."
</p>

<p>
At the command of her mistress Nancy brought her
things.  She was astonished by the readiness of the other
women to help her and not much daunted by their advice.
</p>

<p>
"My mother is an old woman," warned the stepmother,
holding Nancy by her scowling voice, "and like all old
women, much given to strong fancies.  At the moment
her fancy is for you and, because she may not live long, it
is our natural duty to humor her.  Your parents-in-law
and your husband of course have agreed to this and we
expect you to obey her in everything she asks and to make
her comfortable, whatever the cost to yourself.  But do not
forget that an old woman's words are many and her
memory is brief, and that while she may condescend to
honor you as her companion and to say kind things to you,
that gives you no excuse to be proud or to think that you
are better than the rest of us.  She is the head of the
family; she can say what she chooses; but you are still the
least of us, you have to wait your time of authority, like
every person of your years, and if you let your head be
turned by an old woman's flattery, then the day will
come&mdash;and it may come soon&mdash;when you will have bitter
lessons to learn at our hands and at the hands of your
husband.  I tell you this because you have been spoiled too
much already; you have been indulged by your father
and made a little god by a maudlin old nurse, and it would
be a pity if the training we have started to give you had
to be repeated with a stick merely because my worthy old
mother cannot curb her passion for new faces."
</p>

<p>
Usually Nancy was cut to the quick by the malice of
these speeches, but she could afford not to be angry with
words which had no power to back them.  There was the
threat of the future indeed,&mdash;her parole hung upon the
precarious life of the old dowager,&mdash;but a future threat
was better than a present one.  The bride was sufficiently
grateful for her good fortune of the moment not to worry
over her stepmother's brandished cudgel.
</p>

<p>
And for once the cudgel had been brandished more from
habit than from active spite.  Nancy's stepmother, in fact,
had abundant reason to be content, for the old t'ai-t'ai
out of her own lips had suggested a plan her daughter
had been revolving in her mind, the purchase of a Chinese
wife for Ming-te.  She had half promised the youth a
solace for his ill-sorted marriage, but it was a difficult
subject to broach so soon after his wedding.  Nancy might
be obstinate and make trouble; the dowager, in a contrary
mood, might block it.  Herrick's widow was eager to
inflict on the daughter the jealousy she had suffered from
the father's roving desires; she planned further to help
this concubine into Nancy's place till the real wife should
become little better than a servant.  And now, wonderfully
enough, the old t'ai-t'ai, who had to be led so warily
like a balky mule into every project, had blessed the scheme
by proposing it from her own mouth.  She was, in fact,
saving her daughter much strain by breaking it to Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"I am borrowing you, heart and body, from your husband,"
she said; "we can quickly find a substitute for you."
</p>

<p>
"A substitute?" asked Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a substitute to take your place by his side.  If I
steal you, it is only fair that he should be given another
wife in your place."
</p>

<p>
"Then I don't have to go back to him?" inquired the
girl with hope in her voice.
</p>

<p>
The old lady smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That was an unguarded question," she said.  "I fear
you are not properly disturbed at dividing your husband's
affections with another.  No, my child, while I live I think
you will not have to go back to him.  You must pray for me
daily to the god of long life, for after I die&mdash;ah, we can't
discuss that now.  But don't you mind another bride for
your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"I know that I am an unworthy match for your grandson."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  You know nothing of the sort; don't trouble
to speak in this grand manner to me.  I didn't make my
grandson and I am very humble about taking credit for his
amiable qualities.  If you had been a worthy match for
Ming-te then you would never have been worthy to entertain
me in my dotage.  But you are still his wife and you
need not efface yourself from this privilege.  The new
woman, whoever she may be, will be your servant as well
as his and you must teach her to mind you from the first.
These jades are often headstrong and they hide many a
pleasant ambition under their black hair."
</p>

<p>
"I will not hinder her," said Nancy, a little sadly, though
she was glad that her release from Ming-te promised
for months, perhaps for years, to be so complete.  She had
no tender feelings for her husband, none but impulses of
aversion and shame, and yet she was sad because already
she seemed to see her father's splendid dream go toppling,
and the Chinese marriage of his daughter fast becoming no
marriage at all.
</p>

<p>
"That is not a shrewd policy in this family," observed
the lao t'ai-t'ai; "you should always hinder everything.
What will you do when I die?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what I shall do when you die.  I shall not
care much what I do."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, you are the only member of the family who has
not laid plans for that grateful event.  Even the pigs, I dare
say, have disposed of the warmest parts of this chamber to
rest their snouts.  But never mind, we must plan that you
shall not be the loser for helping me.  You are staking more
than you know on the choice you have made to-day."
</p>

<p>
The lao t'ai-t'ai left the subject with this vague promise.
Nancy's trouble passed like a cloud; she trusted the power
of her aged mistress to defend her from evil, recognizing
the wisdom that drew from a fund of experience, to provide
against hazards she herself saw but darkly, yet in the
back of her mind still lurked a sense of pity because her
marriage to Ming-te was being confessed a failure so
quickly.  She could not stamp out a smouldering jealousy
when she saw her place being given to another and knew
that her husband of a month remembered her costly
sacrifice without one tender thought.
</p>

<p>
Soon the household was aflame with new plans.  To take
a concubine, of course, was not to take a wife.  The same
ceremonies could not be used: there could be no scarlet
chair, no procession, no worship of heaven and earth.  But
everything short of full nuptial rites was proposed to give
dignity to Ming-te's second wedding.  Nancy could not
move through the house without feeling that this, in the
eyes of the family, was the real wedding and that they
grudged her the few empty privileges of the wife, as
though she had stolen them.  On this bride they were
putting their hopes, from her body they wanted Ming-te to
beget sons, not from the foreigner, whose half-caste
children could only be the living occasions for explanation
and apology.
</p>

<p>
Hai t'ai-t'ai was as swift in forwarding this wedding as
Nancy's, and, because there were no middlemen to be
bargained with or gifts to be exchanged, she could soon
promise the arrival of the bride whom she personally had
chosen and fetched from Peking.  On a sharp November
day the girl arrived.  The house was crowded to receive
her, for all the members of the family, the neighbors, the
friends, who had been unable to go up to the capital for
Nancy's wedding, made the most of this second event and
feasted loudly and joyfully at the expense of their hosts.
Nancy stood quietly to receive the homage of her new
servant.  She said nothing at the feast and ate little,
listening to the talk of those round her like the stranger she was.
She could not help noticing how they held aloof as though
they did not regard her as one of themselves.  Their eyes
were upon the newcomer who had displaced her, and
Nancy looked too, admitting her pretty face, her dainty
figure, the quick, frightened intelligence of her eyes,
thinking so vividly of her own bridal day that she was ready to
take the girl by the hands and call her sister.
</p>

<p>
But she failed of courage to do this.  This girl, after all,
was being received as a friend whereas she had been
received as an enemy.  The contrast was too bitter.  Nancy
sat out the feast to the end, she tried to abide the amusement
of putting the bride to bed, lest they should hint that
she was jealous, but she knew again, now that people
neglected her, as she had learned with such a shock when
they mocked her, that she was an alien and had no place
among them.  Everyone was so unfeignedly happy to-day.
Ming-te did not need to be made drunk to desire his new
bride.  She had been cheated of this happiness.  Her thought
ran to her father's couplet about the sun and the moon;
she had a sudden desperate longing for Ronald, for the
gay, secure life of the Ferrises; she could not stand the
tumult round her any longer, but fled to her dark room
to hide her misery.
</p>

<p>
It might have been for hours that she wept before a
hand touched her.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you care?" she heard a voice softly asking her.
</p>

<p>
Nancy looked round to see the lao t'ai-t'ai, black against
the light from the next room.  She stood up, ashamed to
be caught weeping, remorseful at having neglected her
mistress.
</p>

<p>
"Do you care?" asked the old lady.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Hm-m, I didn't think you did."
</p>

<p>
The girl started to get out bedding for her mistress and
help her prepare to sleep, but the woman stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"I am not ready to sleep," she said.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes burned with an unslumbering vitality Nancy
had not seen before; everything they had looked upon in
their seventy years seemed to be passing in review; they
quickened with the pride of one who has held her own
sway over time.  Nancy stood spellbound before the dignity
of this ancient woman who used to attend the Eastern
Empress herself a whole fifty years ago; in satin and gold
she was regal, but it was still her eyes which could not be
forgotten, making Nancy believe there were no secrets she
could not read, no mysteries she could not understand,
when she brought to bear upon her own tear-blanched
face the sympathy of one who has walked deep and richly
through experience.  From those far-off glittering days she
seemed to look back at Nancy and to know why she had
been weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Those tears were not for Ming-te," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"No, they were not for Ming-te," Nancy confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Why did your father wish to marry you to him?
Were there no others?  Or did he become tired?"
</p>

<p>
"He became tired," answered Nancy, scarcely knowing
what she said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is our weakness when we become old.  We do
grow tired of searching out the equal of our hopes.  We
have been doing it in vain for so many years that at last
we think the search is useless&mdash;and then we make our
mistakes.  If your father had sat here to-day, he would have
known that you do not belong here, not with these
people."
</p>

<p>
"I belong nowhere," cried Nancy in despair.
</p>

<p>
"You don't belong with sheep and donkeys."
</p>

<p>
The old woman sat meditating.  Then she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there are sheep and donkeys the whole world
over," she reflected.  "Your father thought his own
people were sheep and donkeys and I think mine.  No, my
child, you don't belong to them and you can't always belong
to an old woman like me because I am old and you are
young.  Why were you weeping?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I was lonely and miserable," said Nancy,
surprised by the abruptness of the question.
</p>

<p>
"Lonely, yes, of course, the wise are bound to be lonely.
But you cannot be lonely yet.  You are too young."
</p>

<p>
"I am not lonely with you," Nancy declared.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, my child, you have a way with the old.  You
flatter old bones like mine.  But you are not yet twenty
and I am seventy.  I shall keep you with me; I cannot give
you up.  But when they carry me out to the hills there will
be no place here for you.  Don't you see what I have been
doing?&mdash;what they have been doing too?&mdash;making it
impossible for you to live here.  I came here a stranger too,
like yourself; ai, that was long ago.  My home was in the
south where it is warm and the bamboos foam up the
mountain sides, but not here&mdash;"  With a gesture she
pictured the bleak Chihli plains, drab, leafless country which
the north wind is in a desolate hurry to leave behind.  "Not
here&mdash;and I don't wish you to get used to the smell of
horse-drench and the braying of asses.  You might have
got used to it, ah, that's the pity, but you never can now,
for there is no place for you here.  You will never be the
head of this family.  Ming-te has a new wife; she is your
servant, yes, but the servant will become the mistress.  They
don't tell me that; they think I don't guess their plans;
bah, they think I can live so long and be blind; but if they
came to me and consulted me openly I would tell them
that it is not their plan but mine."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a minute.  Nancy groped for the meaning
hid behind this roundabout speech.
</p>

<p>
"Why were you weeping?" suddenly asked the old
t'ai-t'ai, catching her quite off her guard.  Nancy did not
dare to reply because she knew too well why she had been
weeping.  The distant music, the fear of being left alone
in this dreary household after the old t'ai-t'ai had died,
revived the longing for Ronald's protection; just when the
thought filled her heart the abrupt question trapped the
girl.  She blushed, as though her shrewd old protector had
detected the wish itself.
</p>

<p>
"You too, my child, hide things from me," playfully
scolded the lao t'ai-t'ai.  Then she surprised the girl by
another quick turn.  "Did your father ever ask for you a
husband of your own race?  Ming-te was an afterthought,
you know and I know.  Come, you needn't be embarrassed;
a person of my years can discuss these things.  We make
our own laws when we have lived long enough."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know what my father did?" exclaimed Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"You yourself have just told me," laughed the woman.
She smoothed Nancy's hair with the gentle masterful
hands which always radiated such warm feelings of safety,
quelling doubt and uneasiness till the girl shut her eyes as
if she were sinking asleep in a pleasant bed.  "But I didn't
need you to tell me," she continued, "for I knew your
father's nature and I know yours.  Your father was a
better Chinese than most of us; he was a scholar; he was
a gentleman; the old customs were at his finger tips.  But
he couldn't unmake himself and he couldn't unmake his
daughter, and when you grew old enough to be married
his heart must have lost much peace.  He never wanted
you to marry Ming-te.  He had found and lost another
husband for you."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know these things?" cried Nancy again.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," confessed the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Aha, my daughter, now I do truly know why you were
weeping.  You obeyed your father when he didn't want
you to obey him.  I have heard your story and much more
than you thought you were telling me with your lips.  We
old people can't sit on the k'ang all day watching the
strange things men do without seeing many things they
think they have hidden.  But I have marveled at you.  No
daughter ever honored her father as you have done.  Not
a word of complaint, not an unmannerly sentence have
you spoken, not a breath against Ming-te or these women
who persecuted you.  This would be a splendid family, a
glorious family indeed, if it were fit for a daughter like
you.  But it isn't.  You don't belong here.  You and I should
have been young together.  Those were days when men
understood.  What does a republic make us?  Sheep and
donkeys!  No, you don't belong here; and when I die I
will send you where you do belong.  Tell me about the
husband your father first chose for you."
</p>

<p>
"I have told you," said Nancy, carried out of her
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what your father said of him."
</p>

<p>
Nancy, in her excitement, struggled to pull out a piece
of paper which she wore like a talisman.
</p>

<p>
"This is what my father wrote for him," she explained.
</p>

<p>
The old lady took the paper as though she had expected
it.  She held it close to the smoking wick by her bed and
read it twice or three times.
</p>

<p class="poem">

<p>
"Ah, my child," she said, after reading it slowly, "we
should have burned incense before we dared to read this.
We were wrong, wrong, to disobey these words.  They are
the mandate of heaven itself."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stood in a trance.  From far through the house
came the noise of laughter and music.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
</h3>

<p>
Kuei-Lien more than justified her connection with the
Ferris household by the news she was able to bring.  Not so
long after Nancy herself, Ronald knew that Nancy's
husband&mdash;he made a grimace every time he used the
word&mdash;was to take a second wife.  He was pleased.  Any
barrier between Nancy and Ming-te warmed his own
hopes and, from the liberal store of gossip which Kuei-lien
got from Paoling, it seemed that there were real
barriers of distrust between the young couple.  Nancy, he
learned, had become the attendant of the old grandmother,
"a terrible old woman," Kuei-lien volunteered.  This was
not such good news except that serfdom to the old t'ai-t'ai
saved her from bondage to the rest of the family, for the
old lady, declared Kuei-lien, was very jealous of those who
waited upon her, kept them always in sight, always ready
to obey her uncounted whims.  Nancy would have few
chances to see her husband.  Ronald made Edward translate
every phrase of Kuei-lien's voluble information, seeking
what hints he could to guide his own course of action.
</p>

<p>
"How long will things go on like this?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I am not a fortune-teller," she said; "it will go on till
the old t'ai-t'ai dies, at least."
</p>

<p>
"And if the old t'ai-t'ai dies?"
</p>

<p>
"Then she will be free to wait upon her mother-in-law."
</p>

<p>
Kuei-lien smiled, but Ronald saw what she told was
likely.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think she is happy?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"She must be very stupid to be happy in such a place.
Hm-m," she grunted, "I know the family.  Very quarrelsome
they are and they will quarrel with her and make her
a servant because they didn't want her.  They only took
her because of the money.  They show they don't want
her, else why should they get a new wife so soon?  They
want Chinese children.  They will try to give this woman
first place."
</p>

<p>
"Then what hope is there for Nancy?" Ronald inquired
desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she can jump into a well.  The wells at Paoling
are quite salty, but they are deep."
</p>

<p>
Ronald was out of patience with Kuei-lien's grim humor.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't she run away?" he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she could run away, but they would soon follow.
Where could she fly to?  She has lived behind walls all
her life; she doesn't know whether Peking is east, west,
south, or north, and if she asked&mdash;ha, then she would be
discovered.  Chinese girls don't walk through the country
asking their way to Peking."
</p>

<p>
Ronald was growing more and more restive under the
restrictions of custom which kept him from seeing Nancy,
although he knew no obstacle could stop him, were it not
for the obstacles she herself would make.  But he felt the
need to move, to do something, no matter how useless it
might be.
</p>

<p>
"I must go there," he said.  "Are there any foreigners in
Paoling?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is a foreign doctor at the hospital.  Perhaps
there are others, but they cannot help you.  The Chou
family has nothing to do with missionaries.  You would see
the front gate; that is all.  A beggar can see as much."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless Ronald decided to go.  Classes did not stop
till January, but he found out the names of the foreigners
who lived in this isolated town, got letters to them, and
set out on the first of his holidays with no definite plan
except that it was better to be moving than to sit at home
with arms folded.  The weather was bitterly cold.  The
miserable train depressed his spirits.  But even that was
luxury compared to the mule cart in which he jolted all
day.  The country was like a frozen desert; the cart slipped
and plunged and nearly overturned in deep icy ruts.  If he
could get Nancy out of a land like this, Ronald vowed,
never would he venture into it again.
</p>

<p>
The doctor and his wife, having been informed of his
coming, were glad to welcome him.  They thawed his stiff
limbs before a great stove.  His visit interested them the
more because they had heard of a foreign woman hidden in
one of the Chinese families of the town.  The wife,
especially, was sympathetic over every detail of Nancy's
story.  But neither of them could think of any way to see
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"These places are barred to us," the doctor explained,
"except when someone is very ill.  Then, when the patient
has been mauled and mishandled, plastered with dirty
paper and stuck with infected needles, they call us in to
undo the mischief of the Chinese doctors."
</p>

<p>
Just as if to give point to this remark, a servant came in
with a card and a request that he come at once to attend
a sick woman.
</p>

<p>
"Chou Hu-wei," mused the doctor, reading the card; he
turned abruptly to Ronald.  "There is witchcraft in this,"
he said, "this is the very same family you were seeking.
I expect it's the old t'ai-t'ai herself&mdash;didn't you say it
was she that the sister of your young friend was attached
to?  Yes, she must be the one.  These January winds snuff
out old lives.  Ah, dear me, Paoling is not a place to grow
old in."
</p>

<p>
It was the old t'ai-t'ai, the doctor found, and little chance
of life he gave her.  He read her case at the first glance
and knew that the winds had done their work.
</p>

<p>
"Pneumonia&mdash;just what I feared," he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
The urgency of the case, the need of clearing out curious
hangers-on and of getting ventilation to relieve the fumes
of charcoal braziers so fully busied him that it was an
hour before he could pause to notice the help he had been
given by a foreign girl in Chinese clothes.  The patient
was as comfortable as she could be, lying sleepless but fully
conscious, like one determined to die with her mind ruling
to the last, not in the craven manner to let death sneak
upon her when she was senseless.  Nancy stood by her
side, but with the same rigid control over her nerves.
</p>

<p>
"I expected to find you here," said the doctor.  "Only
to-day a visitor has come from Peking, a Mr. Nasmith&mdash;ah,
you know him, I see; he is your brother's guardian.
He came especially to find out whether you were
well."
</p>

<p>
"What does he say?" asked the t'ai-t'ai, letting no
movement escape her vigilant eyes, even in her pain, so
that Nancy's start at Ronald's name gave her the hint
that something weighty had been said.
</p>

<p>
"He says that the man whom my father first chose for
my husband has come to Paoling," answered Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, it is fate," exclaimed the t'ai-t'ai.  "I know now
my time is finished.  I will die.  You must not wait for me,
child.  You must go back to him."
</p>

<p>
At these words Nancy's endurance crumpled.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no," she cried, "you must not die!  What can
I do if you die?  I don't want to go back.  I want to stay
with you.  Don't let her die," she begged the doctor,
forgetting, so excited she was, to speak English.
</p>

<p>
She fell down beside the bed and hid her face in her
hands.
</p>

<p>
"I am not your sun, child," said the old woman softly;
"you must not grieve for me.  Of course I must die, but I
shall take these words of yours with me; I shall not need
any other sacrifice.  They will burn money and houses and
servants and weep on my grave till the sand has scoured
the name from my stone, but I shall pay no attention to
any of these; I shall always hear your words and smell
them like burning sandalwood."
</p>

<p>
But Nancy would not be comforted.  She jumped up
again and faced the doctor with glowering eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You will not let her die, will you?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, child, keep up your courage," said the
doctor in his steadiest tones, "we won't talk of dying yet.
You do your part and I will do mine."
</p>

<p>
He diverted her attention with many precautions about
the care of the patient and about keeping the room free
from intruders, while all the time the old t'ai-t'ai listened
with a smile on her lips as though she deemed they were
taking many needless pains.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen the girl you were looking for," he told
Ronald, when he had come home again, "and you can set
your heart at rest about one thing; she has not been
ill-treated by the old t'ai-t'ai she is serving.  I don't know
what her relations with the rest of the family may be; I
can guess that they have not been happy.  But as to her
feelings for the old t'ai-t'ai&mdash;well, I have been beside
many deathbeds and I have never seen such an outburst
of grief and love."
</p>

<p>
He detailed the scene exactly as it had happened before
his eyes.  Ronald was puzzled.  He had heard such evil
things about Nancy's aged mistress, such harsh pictures
had been painted by Kuei-lien's vivid tongue, that he could
not think of her as anything but an enemy.
</p>

<p>
"You say she told Nancy not to wait but to come to me?"
</p>

<p>
"That certainly was what I gathered.  I have been twenty-five
years in China; I don't often mistake words as
clear as hers."
</p>

<p>
Ronald groaned.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if she is going to sacrifice herself once more,
just to please this old woman," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had been moved by his impression of Nancy's
love and also by the quiet dignity with which the sick
woman bore her illness.  He was a little out of patience
with Ronald's remark, which sounded both hard and
selfish.
</p>

<p>
"It seems foolish to you, no doubt," he said testily,
"but more of her spirit would not be bad for the world.
She knows her duty and is going to do it, no matter what
you or I choose to say, and she thinks her old mistress is
worth the sacrifice.  For my part, I say more power to
her arm.  Pluck like that is not going to lose in the end."
</p>

<p>
"Yet the old t'ai-t'ai is going to die, isn't she?" asked
Ronald.
</p>

<p>
"I should say, yes.  She is very ill and pneumonia doesn't
spare people at her age.  But of course there is no
certainty in these matters.  Your friend might make her
live&mdash;I have seen miracles like that before&mdash;if it were not
for the fact that the old lady quite evidently thinks it is
time to die and has made up her mind to die.  The Chinese
will do that, you know, when they grow old; sometimes
their families suggest it to them because they have become
feeble and a nuisance.  That's a side of filial piety we don't
hear advertised.  But when they make up their minds
to die, when they deliberately set themselves to give up the
ghost,&mdash;I knew one old man who passed in ten days from
sound health to the coffin,&mdash;when they do that, they are
past praying for.  I doubt if this old woman will live for
all the doctors in the world.  She seems to think she can
help your friend by dying now."
</p>

<p>
"But if she dies, how will Nancy fare with the rest of
the family?"
</p>

<p>
"Hm-m, I don't think she expects a very cordial time.
Probably it will be spear against buckler, as the Chinese
say."
</p>

<p>
"It was extraordinary," Ronald observed, beginning to
pick up one by one the astonishing details of what the
doctor had heard, "it was extraordinary that the t'ai-t'ai
should have told Nancy to come to me."
</p>

<p>
"It was extraordinary indeed.  I have never heard the
like.  For one of her position&mdash;in the husband's family,
mind you&mdash;advising a hsi-fu to run away, that's
absolutely without precedent.  I don't understand it, however
much she may like your friend Nancy.  Of course her being
a foreigner makes a big difference; the family is surely
not keen on a foreign wife,&mdash;that second marriage, done
so soon, proves that,&mdash;but they took her with their eyes
open and they would not relish the poor compliment of
her running away.  Did her father, by the way, ask you first
to be this girl's husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," acknowledged Ronald.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't tell me that, you know.  Were you engaged
to her?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Well, your being here has become, for some reason,
very important in the old t'ai-t'ai's eyes.  Perhaps you can
untangle it."
</p>

<p>
Ronald thought he could, though he did not trouble the
doctor with his reasons, for the latter was ready for bed
and said frankly that daylight solved more puzzles than
lamplight.  The t'ai-t'ai had made a curious remark about
the sun.  This gave the lover his cue; he lay awake nearly
till daybreak going back and forth over scenes of the past:
the importance Herrick ascribed to the scrolls he had
written; Nancy's surprise when she saw them; the indication
that the t'ai-t'ai knew of them.  The sentences danced
in his brain till he became afraid of them.  Herrick must
have trafficked with black art when he wrote those lines.
They were always promising him Nancy, always withholding her.
</p>

<p>
At times he felt like copying the passive manners of
the East and sitting, hands in lap, waiting for the prophecy,
if prophecy it were, to fulfill itself, but his restless
Western blood would not keep him still.  The excitement of
having Nancy so near, of almost having been given her by the
unlooked-for command of the t'ai-t'ai, this was too urgent
for sleep.  Perhaps the old woman would die to-day, and
Nancy would come.  His fingers ached to pull away the
curtain of these next few hours.  He dared not hope too
much.  If that evil family hid her away again, he was ready
to drag down their sagging house round their ears.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour struck from the clock beneath his
bedroom.  He wondered whether Nancy were standing vigil
over the dying woman whom he envied because she loved.
If only he could keep vigil with her!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV
</h3>

<p>
The strokes of the clock came too quickly for Ronald.
They woke him each time just when he was drowsy, telling
him that it was two, three, four, and he was not yet
asleep.  The clock struck more slowly for Nancy.  She sat
alone in the sick room; she was absolute mistress here;
the orders of the doctor, the t'ai-t'ai's imperious will, which
was as strong as ever in its effect upon the family,
supported the girl in her right to keep the room clear.
</p>

<p>
"I want no snivelling humbugs in here," said the
implacable old lady.
</p>

<p>
Apart from making polite inquiries, the others were
glad to leave Nancy the burden of the sick chamber.  She
sat in quiet, broken only by the hard breathing of the
patient, who was also awake.  She was not tempted to doze.
There were too many puzzles of her own to unravel.  Her
fortunes hung in the balance again, with the fortuitous
coincidence of Ronald's arrival in Paoling and the t'ai-t'ai's
sudden, withering illness.  She wished Ronald had not
come.  She was afraid of the sign, connecting it, as did the
old t'ai-t'ai herself, with her death.  And she had wanted so
grievously to be left, if only for a few months, in the
peace which had come since her protector had extracted
her secret of the sun and the moon.
</p>

<p>
She was in the mood which her father had surprised
long ago when he asked his daughter to whom he should
marry her and she shirked the question, saying that she
did not wish to be married at all.  She knew she belonged
to Ronald, her heart spoke unhesitatingly in his defense,
but she lacked courage to meet his claims; they promised
so much trouble, so much stress and uneasiness, perhaps
a catastrophe worse than the marriage which had seemed
so certainly to destroy all hope.  Because she cherished
this hope given back to life again, she wanted to treat it
tenderly, to nourish it in the quietness of her mind, to
allow it months of rest and growth, not to expose it
suddenly to the storms of decision, saying it must be
settled now or never.  She dreaded casting everything upon
the chances of a day to know whether she must live or
die.  She had no heart to face Ronald now.  And yet he
had come, and her aged friend was dying.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The past weeks had been happier beyond measure.  Nancy
had had nothing further to conceal from the old t'ai-t'ai.
They understood one another perfectly.  The t'ai-t'ai,
having decided that Herrick's scrolls were the will of heaven,
never turned back from this belief.
</p>

<p>
"These things are ordained," she had declared; "we
can't fight against them."
</p>

<p>
She had walked with Nancy in the dried remnants of a
garden which was the only breathing space the Chou
family could boast.  The paths were weedy and overgrown,
the pond shrunk to a few pailfuls of stale water, withered
vines hung from a summer house which was too chilly for
them to enter.  But Nancy had memories of winter
sunshine, warm when the wind did not blow, and of blue
unclouded skies, and she never forgot the picture of this
imperious old woman who never deigned to lean upon her
gnarled red cane, but walked erect, letting the sun glow
proudly upon her white hair and bring mellow lustre from
her jacket, which was dyed the stain of crushed cherries.
The t'ai-ta'i had been a gay, unbent figure on days like
those; the shape of an irascible tyrant, which her family
dreaded so cravenly, she seemed to have left within doors
to stand guard against her return.  Meantime she took her
holiday to pour out for Nancy's ears all the wealth of
experience she had stored in the long changing years of her
life.  In recounting days at court, days when her husband
wore the Emperor's button in his hat, and the peacock's
feather, when he presented himself for an audience at
the mysterious morning hour of three, his coat dazzling
with twisted dragons, with a border rainbow-colored to
show sunlight foaming across waves of the sea, her eyes
grew luminous as they often did when she looked on
Nancy; she became almost tolerant of her successors and
their failure.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven made them fools," she exclaimed, half pityingly.
"They could only do what they had it in them to do."
</p>

<p>
Nancy had never interrupted those stories.  Her taste
was not spoiled, like the taste of too many Western
children, by a surfeit of books and papers.  She was hearing
romance from the lips of one who had lived.  Half shutting
her eyes she let the sun draw bright patterns from her
lashes and fancied herself strolling through the painted
corridors of the lake palaces.  Her childish fancy returned.
She should have been born earlier.  She should have been
one of the maidens chosen for the Emperor.  Then perhaps
she could have won his love.  Her heart relaxed into
meditating upon imaginary pictures which never could have
been true, but which were pleasant to think about, wound
about her as they were by the golden haze of the old t'ai-t'ai's
memories.  But they made her slightly disdainful of the
West, till even the home of the Ferrises seemed common-place
compared with her dreams of a barge punted lazily
through the flowering heads of the lotus or the indolence
of sipping tea in a red pavilion beside a still pool.
</p>

<p>
"No, those times are gone," said the t'ai-t'ai with a
sigh, "they won't return in our day.  And you, my child,
will never be one of the ladies of the Emperor."  She smiled
quietly at Nancy's conceit.  "But you can still hold these
things in your heart; you can paint them and make them
into verses for your children.  For you will have many
children and you will teach them to love China."
</p>

<p>
Nancy flushed at the t'ai-t'ai's prediction and wondered
whose these unborn children should be.
</p>

<p>
As for the old woman, she allowed no doubt of her
meaning.  She now kept no secrets from the girl and was
almost savage in her frankness, unleashing her scorn for
the degenerate crowd which cluttered the family gates.
</p>

<p>
"You will not stay here," she repeated, times without
count, "you must not stay here.  If you were one of their
blood,"&mdash;the t'ai-t'ai, in the pronouns she used, spoke as
if even she and her family were different races,&mdash;"if you
were one of their blood, it would be harder; they wouldn't
wish to let you go, and your old family wouldn't want
you back; there would be lawsuits till the end of time.
But this is so simple.  You are foreign born; when once
you have gone, they will not weep for you.  They might
stop you if they saw you going, but only for face; after
you have gone they will say, 'Oh, she was nothing but a
foreigner.  What use was there keeping her here?'"
</p>

<p>
So imperative did she become that Nancy asked once
in astonishment: "Do you wish me to leave you?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah no," laughed the old lady, "you know that was
not my meaning.  You are more nearly kin to me than the
children of my own flesh.  I could not bear to part with
you now and spend the rest of my days among fools.
But neither can I bear the thought that you should spend
the rest of your days&mdash;so many more than mine&mdash;as a
slave to fools.  So we must plan, you and I, how you are
to go when I die.  Ha, it's lucky I am old and can see things
clearly.  Twenty years ago I should have loved you just
as much, my child, but I should never have had boldness
enough to counsel the wife of my grandson to escape.  Now,
when I come to die, I command you to go, or I shall not
die peacefully."
</p>

<p>
"But you are not going to die for years and years,"
laughed Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"This is my seventy-third winter," said the old lady,
startling her with one of those sudden burning looks which
made her eyes blaze, "my seventy-third winter, and my
last."
</p>

<p>
Weakly Nancy protested, but by this time she knew too
well that the t'ai-t'ai did not predict idly; her words, like
her own father's scroll, seemed to get themselves fulfilled.
The thought had looked absurd when she saw how straight
the old woman carried herself, but it lurked in the back
passages of her brain and came forward many a time
during the ensuing weeks when the t'ai-t'ai abruptly would
shatter her desire to dwell secure in comfortable, comforting
talks by saying, "I&mdash;I shall soon die."  Nancy came
to believe, in spite of herself, and to watch, with the
fascination of one who has been bewitched, the first marks
of death upon the face of her aged friend.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid of only one thing," said the t'ai-t'ai, "I
am afraid of you.  I am afraid that you will be too proud
to escape when my time comes.  So you must remember
that it will be my express command then that you go.  I
am your father and mother now; you owe your obedience
to me.  I am the head of the family into which you have
married; I take upon myself your duties to this family;
when I go to my ancestors, I shall report to them what I
have done and they will approve; we were not wont to be
a small-livered people and we did not resist the will of
heaven.  Ah, my daughter, you have always obeyed, you
have understood my wishes before I asked them.  We cannot
tamper with the mandate of heaven; your fate is your
fate and you must accept it.  You must go back, I say, to
the husband your father first chose for you.  You must
bring him many sons to honor him and to honor you.
Here you will be childless and forsaken.  What comfort
shall I have among the dead when I remember this?  I
will not eat of your sacrifices till you promise me this
one thing.  I will go like a starved spirit, I tell you, and be
homeless and cold till you promise me.  Will you promise
me?  Will you promise me?  I demand it of you now because
I know that I shall die."
</p>

<p>
Nancy had never seen the t'ai-t'ai so shaken by feeling.
She felt she had trespassed upon a queen in one of those
moments of human passion which a mere subject must pay
with his life to witness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she whispered, falling down because she dared
not look her mistress in the face, "I will promise you; I
will go, but I cannot go till you are dead."
</p>

<p>
"That may be too late, my child."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot go till you are dead&mdash;and oh, I don't
want you to die."
</p>

<p>
"That may be too late."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot promise more than that," vowed Nancy, with
a firmness that would not be denied.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai stooped and lifted her up.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course you can't," she agreed, laughing gayly.
"I know you can't.  You can't help being yourself.  But
at least I have your promise that you will go after I am
dead; you will not think yourself bound to linger here,
wife and no wife, making yourself miserable and others
spiteful.  That is not any duty you owe to your father, or
to me, or to Ming-te&mdash;he has a wife who is only waiting
to take your title."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a moment and then burst out again in
tones of indignation:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah, why can't other people see things clearly?  I know
my daughter and my daughter-in-law; I know every
thought in their heads.  They don't want you here and
yet they won't want to let you go.  They have a hundred
imaginary scores to pay, scores against you, scores against
me.  They are angry even now because I protect you.
They would pull down the family rather than forgo one
item of the spite they ache to visit upon you.  And why?&mdash;for
no cause at all except their own greed.  They gloat
over the thought of humbling you and shaming you.
They would have done it anyway because you will be helpless
and in their power and because everything that goes
wrong in their lives will be your fault.  But they will be
harsher now because I have taken you for my friend.  They
will remember every bit of honest advice I gave them
and then they'll say, 'The old t'ai-t'ai said this and the
old t'ai-t'ai said that, but the old t'ai-t'ai is dead; what
shall we do?  Ah, let's go and beat the foreign hsi-fu.'"
</p>

<p>
Nancy could not help laughing at the droll accuracy of
this picture.  It was such as Kuei-lien might have
portrayed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you laugh," sniffed the old woman, having joined
in the laugh herself, "but it is only because you see how
lifelike are my words.  You can fancy your p'o-p'o, after
a good cry on my grave, after calling out, 'Venerable and
sacred old mother, you have left your undutiful, ignorant
daughter-in-law blinded with tears, unable to eat or to
sleep from her grief for you; come back and let me grovel
at your feet and make amends for my ten thousand unfilial
sins.'  You can see her coming home, saying, 'Heaven
be praised, the old hag is dead.'  Eh, she will make you eat
with the pigs and sleep with the dogs.  No, my child, if
you will stay till I am dead you must be wary, you must
be clever; there are foreigners in this place; go to them
and go quickly, and remember what your father wrote for
you.  These women, pooh! they don't want you, yet they
will try to keep you here so that they can spit on you till
their lips shrivel round their yellow teeth."
</p>

<p>
Nancy did not enjoy these petulant storms and was glad
when her mistress returned to sunnier moods.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai did not take up the subject again.  The
next were days of unequaled calm.  The weather was mild,
as sometimes it will be in the deep of winter.  A drowsy
peace settled on the whole household after the excitement
of the autumn.  Nancy moved at ease through the
house, often meeting the pretty, gentle girl who was so
much more Ming-te's wife than she, and every time they
met it was with a friendly greeting, every time with a
pleasing deference on the part of the latest newcomer to
the foreigner who in name was her mistress.  Nancy's
stepmother, her mother-in-law, both withheld their scoldings
as if they were grateful to her for keeping the old
t'ai-t'ai out of mischief; it seemed hard to believe they
were storing venom against her.  Ming-te Nancy never
saw.  He was busy with his studies.  The father was away.
The relatives, who had been a burden to the family chest,
had taken their squabbling children home.
</p>

<p>
Nancy had unbroken leisure to read to the t'ai-t'ai, to
listen to her, to match poems with her keen old mind.
And many still afternoons they walked in the garden,
enjoying sunshine so tranquil that Nancy lost all but the
faintest shadow of dread that her friend might die.  Death
could not intrude upon this unclouded weather.  She
laughed at death and was willing to go on like this till she
too was old, hearing the golden echo of famous times from
the lips of a masterful, good-humored old woman.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then came the wind and the dust hiding the sun, drifting
through the frail protection of paper windows, laying
floors and tables and chairs thick with sifted sand from
the desert.  Then came cold and snow and again the fierce
voice of the north wind, its icy breath which no defense
could keep out, numbing the faces and hands of those who
tried to stand against it.  People shivered and huddled on
the k'ang to get what comfort they could from its warmth.
The change fell so swiftly that Nancy could not shake
herself all at once out of the calm which had been lulling her
fears.  And when she awoke it was only to outward
amazement at the violence of a tempest such as she had
never seen in Peking, such as she could not see except in
these bleak villages of the Chihli plains, where the gales of
half Asia rushed down unthwarted, trying to tear roofs
from their walls, doors from their fastenings, courage from
human hearts.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For a day the t'ai-t'ai must have complained of a chill
before Nancy paid particular heed.  She had been attentive,
of course, from the first because, as the old woman had
said, the girl outguessed every wish.  But after a day when
the chill had not begun to mend, but was growing worse,
Nancy felt a doubt slip like ice through her veins.  She
remembered the t'ai-t'ai's prediction.  In an instant
she realized that death might already have stolen his
march: that it was a treacherous little chill like this, so
rapidly growing worse, which might end the old woman's
seventy-three indomitable years.  Fever, pain, coughing.
Nancy was frightened by the remorseless haste they
made, the way they tore down the strength of her mistress.
</p>

<p>
Backed by the wish of the sick woman, she forced the
family to send for the foreign doctor, an act they were
most reluctant to do, dismayed that the t'ai-t'ai at her age
should turn from the tried ways of the Chinese physician.
If she died the blame would not be theirs.
</p>

<p>
The foreign doctor had come.  Nancy read in his face
how little hope there was.  And he had brought the news
of Ronald's appearance in Paoling.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts upside down, her mind confused, her heart
afraid, Nancy sat through the long desolate hours of the
night groping for the power to understand these fresh
blows fate had dealt her.  She had a promise to think of,
and she wondered how she could keep it.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV
</h3>

<p>
In the morning the doctor came again.  He found no
change in his patient, who still lay open-eyed on her bed,
evidently thinking, though she did not talk.  It hurt her
too much to talk.  She seemed content when the doctor
assured her Ronald was still in Paoling and in no
immediate hurry to go.
</p>

<p>
"You can bring him with you the next time you come,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
The doctor looked rather anxiously toward Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"You must take some rest yourself, my child," he said.
"I can't have two sick people on my hands."
</p>

<p>
The old t'ai-t'ai seemed to understand what he was
saying.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, tell her to sleep," she insisted; "she must sleep.
I shall be all right.  My daughter can look after me."
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly Nancy gave up her post to her stepmother.
She was sure she could not sleep.  There were too many
problems on her mind.  Yet such was her need of rest that
her eyes closed from sheer heaviness and nothing more did
she know till she awoke late in the afternoon, surprised to
find the storm abated and clear, cold sunshine gleaming
through the paper windows of her room.  Hurriedly she
dressed and opened the door.  The t'ai-t'ai turned her eyes
when the girl entered and greeted her with a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
"Death is a slow business," she said, with the coolest of
voices.  She seemed to talk with more ease.  Nancy did
not guess how she had taken advantage of her own absence
to defy the doctor's orders and speak out her mind to her
daughter.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with this girl when I die?"
she had begun.
</p>

<p>
"Do?" echoed Nancy's stepmother, "what should I do?
I am not her husband.  I am not her mother-in-law, am
I?  What should I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I asked you what you are going to do with her,"
repeated the old woman, with an acid inflection to the
question.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want done with her?" countered the
daughter, anxious to see where her mother's words were
leading.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to let her go.  She does not belong here.
Ming-te has a wife; he is contented.  I want you to send
her back to her own people."
</p>

<p>
"But that would cause scandal."
</p>

<p>
"Scandal, nonsense!  No more scandal than was caused
by your bringing her here in the first place or by your
keeping her here.  No one thinks scandal of what a
foreigner does.  People simply say they are crazy&mdash;that
is the end of it.  She will be forgotten in a week.  That
would be much more comfortable for all of you than to
have to keep explaining her presence."
</p>

<p>
"You will tire yourself if you talk too much," remonstrated
the younger woman.  "It is not good for your sickness."
</p>

<p>
"What do I care what is good for my sickness?" exclaimed
the t'ai-t'ai.  "I am going to die anyway.  I shall
have plenty of time to be silent then."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say such things," spoke out the other,
pretending to be shocked.  "You are not going to die.
This cold that you are suffering from, that will soon pass.
You have lived too long to be snuffed out by the first
winter gale."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think this is a time to be honest?" asked
her mother.
</p>

<p>
The other woman avoided an answer.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to let her go, as I asked you?" went on
the old t'ai-t'ai.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there will be plenty of time to talk of that presently.
This is no occasion to discuss such important plans.
It's not for me to decide, anyway, what we ought to do
with Nancy.  That is for the others to determine."
</p>

<p>
"What you decide, they too will decide."
</p>

<p>
"You must have your broth now," said the daughter,
trying to make light of the obstinate way her mother clung
to her demands.  "Why vex yourself about these things
now?  To-morrow will be time enough for a decision.
There are so many things to be considered.  It's no use
being too hasty."
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing to be considered, her happiness and
yours.  For don't deceive yourself by thinking you will
be happy if you keep the girl.  We can't flaunt our spite
in the face of heaven.  And I tell you this marriage is
against heaven itself; I have seen and I know.  And
everyone who has anything to do with it is cursed.  What
happened to her father?  He died, the day of her marriage.
And before another year is out, if you keep her here, you
will be dead too.  Are you going to release her or are you
going to force me back from the dead to set her free?
You have found me a stubborn old woman in life and you
will find me more stubborn in death."
</p>

<p>
Not only had the voice of the sick woman gained its
full power, but the old magical ascendancy of her will had
asserted its strength.  Her threat stirred the superstitious
heart of her daughter.  The boldness which had been
gaining ground at the expense of her mother's weakness
retreated again before a fear she did not know how to
dispel, a vague intangible fear, here one minute, there the
next, always eluding her when she tried to grapple with it,
when she tried to laugh it down, the fear that a curse did
in truth lie heavy upon Nancy's marriage to Ming-te.
She remembered with terror how they had labored to
straighten out Herrick's stiffened limbs.
</p>

<p>
"When do you want us to send her away?" she asked,
after a sullen pause.
</p>

<p>
"When she asks to go," answered the t'ai-t'ai.
</p>

<p>
The daughter ransacked her mind for some pretext to
avoid a promise, but she knew her mother too well of old,
knew that she was not easily hoodwinked when she wanted
a direct answer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah well, it can't be helped," she said finally.  "If you
really order me to do this, what can I do but obey?  I will
not keep her here.  I will send her off."
</p>

<p>
The old woman gave a sigh of relief and said no more.
The task of overriding her daughter, short and sharp
though it had been, had cost too much of her strength.
She had summoned every atom of her indomitable will
to cower her adversary into making this unwilling promise.
She had spoken as though the fortunes of life and death, of
heaven and hell, were in her hands, and so extensive had
been her mastery of this grumbling family that even the
self-willed daughter flinched from the shadow of her curse.
But her strength was failing; she knew how much had
been spent in this passionate plea for Nancy; in her hour
of weakness they might lose their dread of her temper,
grow bold like village mongrels round a dying wolf.
She lay quiet, husbanding what force remained, determined
to keep her lifelong spell hard upon them to the
end.
</p>

<p>
Her daughter felt it was safe to leave the patient for an
hour.  She got into long discussion with Nancy's
mother-in-law over the promise which had been wrung out of her
by the t'ai-t'ai.  They talked the matter to and fro, back
and forth, nosing out ways to evade the spirit while they
kept the letter of this pledge.  Away from the sick room, in
the still cold sunshine which had followed the storm, the
death of the old lady who had ruled them so long did not
really seem so near at hand as to alarm them.  Nor did it
seem so in the sick room itself when Nancy appeared and
found the t'ai-t'ai apparently resting.
</p>

<p>
Nancy felt stronger after her sleep and could not understand
that her mistress had not been refreshed at the same
time.  When the sick woman said, "Death is a slow business,"
the girl was inclined to treat the remark lightly.  The
house seemed comfortingly peaceful after the wind which
had been raging round the courtyards and tearing tiles
loose from the eaves.
</p>

<p>
But the doctor, when he came, was not so well satisfied.
He looked at the thermometer, and he shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"You have been exerting yourself," he said; "there is
more fever here than there should be."
</p>

<p>
"Of course there is fever," scoffed the patient; "how
can one be sick and not have fever?"
</p>

<p>
As for exerting herself, she laughed at the notion.
What exertion could an old woman make when she was
kept tied to her bed?
</p>

<p>
"Did you think I would jump up and play shuttlecock
like a schoolboy?"
</p>

<p>
She dismissed the subject of her infirmities.  "Have you
brought him?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
The doctor knew whom she meant.  "Yes, I brought
him," he said, "but I am not sure it would be good for
you to see him."
</p>

<p>
"It would not be good for me not to see him."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, have your own way," consented the doctor,
humoring her stubbornness, "but don't go wasting your
strength with too many words."
</p>

<p>
He went to the door and called Ronald, who had
been waiting in a room outside.  Nancy, standing at the
opposite side of the bed, looked at the newcomer.  She had
not expected him.  Her face flushed with embarrassment.
She dared not lift her eyes again, but tried quietly to
withdraw from the room.
</p>

<p>
"No, you must stay," said the t'ai-t'ai, who had observed
her confusion with a swift glance.  "I may need you
to explain what I wish to say."
</p>

<p>
Then she turned her attention to Ronald, giving him a
long exacting stare.  It was evident she did not quite know
how to appraise him.  She was not used to foreigners, for
Nancy, although she spoke of her theoretically as a Westerner,
in the intimacy of her affection she always regarded
as Chinese.  So she faltered for a moment at her first
sight of Ronald, vaguely disappointed, till she saw that he
was transparently honest and kind and that he loved
Nancy; then she took refuge in Timothy Herrick's
judgment,&mdash;who, after all, was better able than he to judge a
man of his own race?&mdash;and thought, with an inward
chuckle, that if the gods themselves had come to claim
Nancy she would not have deemed the wisest and the
handsomest of them good enough.
</p>

<p>
She looked again at Nancy's blushing face.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, my child tenderly displays the reflection of the
sun," she quoted, in a voice too low for any but Nancy
to hear, and laughed contentedly to see the girl blush
even more.  "Never mind, never mind, tut, tut, tut,
tut, it is good to be young.  I won't ask you to
translate for me."
</p>

<p>
This office she imposed upon the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," she said, "that Nancy is free to go.  I am
the head of this family and I have given my permission,
and I have the promise of her stepmother for the rest
of them, and I have her own promise that she will go.
This marriage was a mistake.  We disobeyed heaven when
we made it.  I have learned some things I did not know
before&mdash;he ought to understand what I mean&mdash;and
I cannot die with peace in my heart until I have set this
mistake right.  Is that clear?"
</p>

<p>
It was entirely clear.
</p>

<p>
"She can go this very minute; that would be the best
plan," said the old t'ai-t'ai playfully.  "Will you go now,
Nancy?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head back and forth quickly like a
punished child refusing to be good.
</p>

<p>
"There, you see," exclaimed the woman, half jesting,
half sorry, "you see how stubborn and self-willed she is.
Now that I have become old and helpless even she won't
obey me."
</p>

<p>
A deep silence followed, during which everyone seemed
wondering what to say.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's no use," went on the t'ai-t'ai at last, "I've
tried my hardest to persuade her to go.  But she refuses.
She must wait till I am dead.  He will stay in Paoling?"
she asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the doctor answered for Ronald.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  He will not need to wait long."
</p>

<p>
Even the doctor, cheerful as he had been, was not brave
enough to contradict her with a lie.  He had directed Nancy
in all that she could do&mdash;all that anyone could do, now,
he thought to himself.  Promising to return early in the
morning, he took Ronald away with him.
</p>

<p>
Ronald could not speak.  His brain carried a picture of
the marvelous old woman lying shrunken and helpless on
the couch, her face burning with fever, her eyes, wistful
and bright, searching him for every sign that he was fit
to marry Nancy.  The girl he loved so utterly seemed
almost a shadow in comparison; he had only ghostlike
glimpses of her averted face.  With a deep groan he
wondered if he were ever going to win her.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the doctor had left, Nancy's stepmother
and her mother-in-law came to inquire what he had said,
but the t'ai-t'ai did not encourage them to stay.  She was
doing as well as one could hope, she told them; she was
tired and did not want to talk.  She knew that her daughter
would be filled with curiosity about Ronald's visit, but she
would explain nothing, only asking to be left alone, with
Nancy watching her.
</p>

<p>
Ronald's appearance had indeed excited the stepmother,
who remembered him angrily as Herrick's executor.  She
hated him because of the trust that had been shown him by
her husband, the powers that had been given him in her
rightful place.
</p>

<p>
"So that's the game!" she exclaimed.  "That's what the
shameless girl has been working for, is it?  That's why
she has turned my poor old mother's head and made her
play the fool in her dotage!"
</p>

<p>
She choked in her wrath.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy her cunning in getting that meddlesome barbarian
here.  Who ever heard the like to her treachery?
And he, not satisfied with stealing our money, now dares
to steal our wives out of our houses."
</p>

<p>
She raved in her hatred of Nancy.  Every grudge she
could rake up from the past, every quarrel Nancy had had
with Li-an, every childish offense went into a score which,
if she had dared, she would have torn the girl limb from
limb to erase.  "That miserable promise!" she kept
repeating, vexing herself half mad to find ways of
breaking it.
</p>

<p>
The victim of her hatred stood profoundly quiet beside
the bed of the dying woman.  The latter had heaved a
great sigh when she found herself at last with only Nancy
watching her.
</p>

<p>
"I have done all I can," she said.  "Your life is in your
own hands now, my jewel.  If I were only strong enough
to take you away from here with my own arms&mdash;I am so
afraid for you, I am still so afraid for you.  But I can do
no more.  I am no good.  I am too old."
</p>

<p>
These were the first despondent words Nancy had ever
heard her proud old mistress use.  She dared not weep, but
sat down and put her hand on the sick woman's forehead,
trying to cool the heat of the fever, to repay something of
the debt of gentle caresses she owed.
</p>

<p>
"Sing to me," said the t'ai-t'ai at last.
</p>

<p>
Of all the songs she knew, Nancy could think of none
but the song Kuei-lien had sung to her the night before her
wedding.  It had gone ringing through her head for days
afterward and now, when she knew but would not confess
her mistress was dying, nothing else could so contain her
fear and her love.
</p>

<p>
Nancy's voice was not Kuei-lien's.  It was more closely
a child's voice, artless, straightforward, and simple, but
she sang very clearly, very tenderly, till even the candles
seemed to stop flickering and the old woman shut her eyes,
letting her mind drift into contented reverie from the peace
she got in knowing that Nancy was near.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Swift the summer sun in his day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift the autumn moon in her night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow the winter frost with its blight,<br>
  Trampling golden leaves from its way.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Gold youth, scarlet love, each must fade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon and stars cease shining in the night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter snows shall long glimmer white,<br>
  Scarlet leaves and gold low are laid."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Nancy stopped.  She wanted to hide her face again, but
there was no place to hide.  She had to bear up for the
sake of her friend.  But the song unloosed such overwhelming
memories that she had to sit speechless, tensely
careful not to move lest she let free the tears which were
poised imminently behind the straining floodgates of her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The t'ai-t'ai reached for her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I have lived seventy-three years," she said, "and in
all those seventy-three years this is the most peaceful
moment I have known.  I don't want you to offer me
anything else, child&mdash;incense, food, money, I don't want
them, nothing else but one thing, your happiness.  If you
want me to rest, you must bring me that."
</p>

<p>
She sank back in the bed as if to sleep more comfortably.
Her eyes closed.  Her mind seemed to slip away.  The heat
of the fever mounted.  Nancy busied herself with the
expedients the doctor had suggested, but they brought no
relief.  Again and again she begged the sick woman to
give some sign that she heard, but she got no response.  At
last in despair she woke up her stepmother.  The woman
came rushing in, half dressed, took one look.
</p>

<p>
"Ai, she is dying," she cried, and rushed out to call the
family.
</p>

<p>
They had all come in readiness for the worst.  It was only
the work of a few minutes before they were crowding
round the bedside, weeping in terror as they watched the
old t'ai-t'ai's struggles for breath.  Their wailing filled the
room, deafening the last pangs of the dying woman.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she sat bolt upright and looked round with the
caustic look they knew so well.
</p>

<p>
"Humbugs!" she snorted in a cold scornful voice which
struck with double sharpness on their ears because of the
sudden hush in the chamber.  "Humbugs!"
</p>

<p>
Then she dropped back with a gasp on her pillow.  The
old t'ai-t'ai had spoken her mind to the last.
</p>

<p>
There was a shameful pause, as though the family
waited one of her familiar scoldings and could not believe
she was dead.  Her eldest son was the first to rouse
himself.  During the unspeakable silence which still prevailed
he got up slowly and lighted incense and white candles
beside the bed while everyone watched him, spellbound.  Not
till the first spluttering glow of the candles could they
move.
</p>

<p>
When at last they realized that the spirit of the old
t'ai-t'ai was being lighted on her way, they went mad.
Everyone began shouting and crying and tearing his hair;
the women beat their breasts and forced tears from their
eyes.  The room was not large enough to hold the echo
of their weeping.  Yet in the midst of this paroxysm
Nancy could hear her name called.  She looked round.  Her
stepmother was beckoning to her.  The others were so taken
up by their own grief that they paid no heed when Nancy
stumbled over them to emerge from the frenzied circle of
mourners.
</p>

<p>
"I have some work for you to do," whispered her stepmother,
giving her orders about things she was to fetch.
</p>

<p>
Nancy stole out of the room unobserved and went
blindly through the dark house, hearing the din of the
weeping family jangling across every cold courtyard.  She
was too numb with sorrow to think about herself or her
own fate.  She wanted to weep out her heart beside the
body of her mistress.  Nothing else at this moment could
satisfy her.  She found a candle and groped into the room
to which her stepmother had sent her.  Suddenly she heard
a noise and turned.  Only a pace behind her stood the
woman herself.  Nancy saw, with a frightened glance, that
she had no good intent in her mind; she saw her glaring,
like a panther ready to spring.
</p>

<p>
"I promised you should go," said the woman harshly,
"and you're going&mdash;now!  You are not going back there,
do you hear me?  You are not one of us, you don't belong
to this family, and you shall not weep with us just because
you managed to addle the brains of my old mother.  You
killed her.  You are not fit for us to wipe our feet on.  Out
you go, I say!  Go and play the whore with your foreign
friend!  You are a stench in our nostrils.  You slut, you
filthy tortoise, you dirty bawd, what right have you to
think you can go in there and corrupt the dead with your
false tears?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy was staggered by this abuse.  It meant only one
thing in her mind, that she was being robbed of her place
beside the body of her protector.  Her heart could not
grasp the idea of being torn away with this cruel, this
unbelievable abruptness.  She cared nothing for herself,
nothing for her own future; she would have bartered the
freedom of a lifetime just to be allowed to cling to that
lifeless body; she was lost to all reason; she sobbed for
the privilege of being close to her dead mistress as though
more than her life hung upon it.  She could not believe
that her stepmother was in earnest; she could not believe
that she, who had shared the golden beauty of these last
days in the company of her beloved old t'ai-t'ai, should be
driven away like an outcast, like a creature lower than
the dogs which slunk through the open doors.  She opened
her mouth in protest, ready to offer herself as a slave,
but the woman fetched her a stinging blow across the lips.
</p>

<p>
"Your words have done enough mischief in this house,"
she jeered.  "I won't hear more of them."
</p>

<p>
Nancy drew back.  The candle shook in her hand,
throwing ominous, weird shadows across her face.  She was
an animal which has been wounded and does not know the
meaning of the violence dealt to it.  Then from far away,
like a rising gust of wind, came the dismal lamentation of
the mourners.  With a start Nancy dropped the candle.
An overpowering impulse seized her to rush back, back to
her mistress, to throw herself on the floor, to throw herself
on the ground by the bed, and to weep.  Nothing else
mattered.  Nothing else must stand in her way.  She was
mad.  She was indeed an animal, an animal trapped, beating
out its life in its panic to get the one thing it desired.
</p>

<p>
She tried to rush past her stepmother, but there was
light enough from the dim lantern by the door to keep the
woman from being taken unawares.
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't go back," she shrieked, "not a step do
you go back.  Out you go, I say, out! out! out!"
</p>

<p>
She seized the girl with her hands, clawing her face,
tearing her hair.  She was as mad as Nancy and stronger,
and she had her sister-in-law to help her.  The latter had
grabbed Nancy's arms and was pulling them back till the
pain shot like tongues of flame through her tortured body.
Inch by inch they strained toward the door, fighting with
teeth and nails and feet, their breath, too spent for words,
coming and going in convulsive gasps.
</p>

<p>
Nancy writhed and twisted to get out of the grasp of
her tormentors, insensible to more pain, the need to get
back to the side of her dead friend possessing her like a
legion of devils.  But the women were more than she could
stand against.  Slowly they dragged her across the floor; she
contested every inch, but they beat down her strength,
they pommeled her and bruised her and tore her clothes
into long rags, they struck her across the head till she was
almost senseless.  Desperately she struggled, but uselessly,
for the stepmother grasped her throat with sinewy hands
and, pressing tighter and tighter, stifled her till her eyes
were ready to leap from their sockets and her lungs
choked vainly for air.  Then they opened the great gate,
swinging it wide on its creaking axles, and flung the girl,
like a heap of discarded rubbish, into the street.
</p>

<p>
She was not dead.  The cold air forced itself at the price
of agony down her throat.  The blood began moving again.
But her mind had still one single insane thought, to get
back to the deathbed, so as soon as she was able to pull
herself up she plunged against the barred door, throwing
herself again and again upon its unyielding boards,
crying, as she thought, with a voice which could be heard
for miles, but which actually was only the hoarse rattle of
a whisper.  She did not think of Ronald or of anything
else.  She forgot the iron cold clamping its grip on her
veins, chains of steely frost from which no prisoner, once
bound, could escape.  She wanted to get back to her
mistress, back to her mistress or to die.  And what the women
had begun she was in a fair way to complete when a sudden
spell of weariness halted her, a spell of deep warm peace.
She felt the hand of the old t'ai-t'ai on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Do you care?" she heard her voice saying.  "Ah, my
child, my child, why do you care?"
</p>

<p>
It was all right now.  She could sleep and be comforted.
